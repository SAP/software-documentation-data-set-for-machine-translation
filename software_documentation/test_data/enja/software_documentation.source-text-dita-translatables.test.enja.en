Origin of Assets
Shows asset origin by country/region or by supplier.
Shows asset origin displayed either by country/region or by supplier, and the KPI shows the total value.
The data shown is for the fiscal year and period that you selected in the filters.
Note that asset country/region of origin and asset supplier are both non-mandatory fields in the Master Data.
Assets for which this information is not maintained will be included in an unlabeled column on the left of the chart.
You can navigate from this card to the <uicontrol>Asset Balances</uicontrol> app.
Transaction Type
Payment transaction type for processing electronic bank statements.
Use
From the F4 help, you can select one of the payment transaction type that were defined in the configuration activity <uicontrol>Make Global Settings for Electronic Bank Statement</uicontrol>.
The payment transaction type is used in the following scenarios:
Posting rule determination:
In combination with the <uicontrol>External Transaction</uicontrol> on the bank statement item, the posting rule is determined.
In the case that no payment transaction type is specified for a house bank account, the SAP predelivered payment transaction type for the selected format is used during importing the bank statement using the <uicontrol>Manage Incoming Payment Files</uicontrol> app and the <xref keyref="loio6a32ad6153cf447caaceca09813f32f9"/> API.
Bank fee validation:
Together with the bank service mapping in the <uicontrol>Manage Banks</uicontrol> app, it allows the system to identify the service volume for a certain bank service in end-of-day electronic bank statements.
The volume is then used to validate the bank fees in the <uicontrol>Monitor Bank Fees</uicontrol> app.
Please note that for manual bank statements, the system uses the transaction type entered in the manual bank statement.
For more information, see <xref keyref="loiodec4bd6a027148ad8b8102bfaf578bbf">Validating Bank Services Charges</xref>.
Generate
Trigger the creation of the report file.
Use
Trigger the creation of the report file based on the specified data.
Once the generation of the report file is triggered, the report status is automatically changed to <uicontrol>Generation Scheduled</uicontrol> by the system.
The system generates the report file in an <sap-technical-name>.xlsx</sap-technical-name> format.
Once the report generation is completed, the report status is automatically changed to <uicontrol>Generation Finished</uicontrol>.
The report file name is created automatically based on the report name and reporting period selected.
Flexible Distribution
Enables you to create contracts in the connected system for a target quantity or value up to the total that you set in the central contract.
Use
The <uicontrol>Flexible Distribution</uicontrol> feature enables you to create contracts in the connected system for a target quantity or value up to the total that you set in the central contract.
Instead of assigning a fixed share of the quantity or value of the central contract to each of your subsidiaries, you can set the distribution percentage for each connected system to 100%.
As a result, the respective purchasers at each of your subsidiaries can create putchase orders in the connected system for as for as large or small a share as they need, rather than being limited to a fixed share that was predetermined by the central contract.
For example, if you have two subsidiaries, rather than assign each subsidiary a fixed limit of 50%, you can assign each of them 100%.
That way, if one subsidiary only creates purchase orders for 20% of the total value or quantity agreed in the central contract, the other subsidiary would have the flexibility to order up to 80% if they need to.
Note that if you enable flexible distribution, you will not receive an error message if the sum of the distribution exceeds 100%.
Therefore, it is important that you monitor the situation to make sure that your subsidiaries do not create a total sum of purchase orders that exceeds 100%.
Create Variants
Create variants manually or using Microsoft Excel.
Click here to select the option to create variants.
Select <uicontrol>Create Variant</uicontrol> to add a new variant using the <uicontrol>Manage Variants</uicontrol> pane.

This list may consist of both public and private projects depending on the authorizations granted to your business role.
Order Fulfillment Responsibility
The level at which you distribute material quantities.
The order fulfillment responsibility is the basis on which the order fulfillment specialist's worklist is scoped and is therefore the level at which order fulfillment specialists redistribute materials with limited availability to orders.
An order fulfillment responsibility is created for a specific split criterion, for example, a plant or a storage location, or a combination of multiple split criteria.
Order fulfillment responsibilities are created, maintained and assigned to order fulfillment specialists in the <xref keyref="loio36e46c5791ff0322e10000000a44147b"/> app by users who have the business role Order Fulfillment Manager (R0226).
Note that an order fulfillment specialist can be responsible for processing multiple order fulfillment responsibilities.
Use the <uicontrol>Switch Worklist</uicontrol> drop-down to switch between different order fulfillment responsibilities.
Time Zone for Job Start
Choose the time zone.
If you set a time zone here that is different from your server time zone, the system might make adjustments for the scheduling job.
Your time zone is CEST (UTC + 2:00) and the time zone used by your server is UTC.
The <uicontrol>Relative Basic Finish Date</uicontrol> is set to <userinput>-30</userinput>.
The status for <uicontrol>System Status 1</uicontrol> is set to <userinput>Released</userinput>.
You schedule a job for July 31, 2019 at 1 am.
The system will close all orders that have been released 30 days ago according to the server time.
That is, orders that were released on June 30, 2019.
Display Options

<uicontrol>Show Attribute Values and Validity Periods</uicontrol>:
Displays the same information as the previous option, plus the validity periods of the attribute value assignment.
You can also display the attribute value assignments for a selected attribute over time or across versions.
Where no attribute value is assigned to a time- and version-dependent attribute in the selected fiscal year and period and consolidation version, the validity period displays the time frame in which no value is assigned.
You can’t see the validity period in edit mode, you have to switch back to display mode.
Create Tasks

Use
By default, the <uicontrol>Material Availability Check for Maintenance Orders</uicontrol> template is selected.
This template provides enhanced filter parameters and enables you to reassign committed stock from one maintenance order to another of higher priority and urgency.
If you want to use a different template instead, choose the <uicontrol>X</uicontrol> to deselect the default template.
After that you can select a different template from the input list, for example the <uicontrol>PM Orders:</uicontrol>
<uicontrol>Material Availability Check</uicontrol> template.
Origin
Allows to filter service entry sheets by the origin of their data.
A service entry sheet can be created in one of the following ways:
Externally using an interface (integration with another system)
Manually in your SAP S/4HANA system
Based on a timesheet in your SAP S/4HANA system
Using the filter criterion <uicontrol>Origin</uicontrol>, you can decide which service entry sheets are to be displayed in the list.
Buffer
Change the MRP type of your products to make them buffered products
Definition
Allows you to change the products you have selected in the list to buffered products, that is, products relevant for demand-driven replenishment.
You achieve this by changing the <uicontrol>MRP Type</uicontrol>.

Procedure Type
Defines if the reprocessing rule triggers a one- or two-step posting
Definition
There are two procedure types for an automated reprocessing rule.
A reprocessing rule can have bank statement items be posted either in <emphasis>one</emphasis> step or in <emphasis>two</emphasis> steps.
Use
If you want the automated reprocessing rule to post your bank statement items in only one step, select <userinput>001 (One-Step Posting)</userinput> as the value of the <uicontrol>Procedure Type</uicontrol> field.
In this case, leave the <uicontrol>Bank Subaccount</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Journal Entry Type for Bank Subaccount</uicontrol> fields empty.
If you want the automated reprocessing rule to trigger a two-step posting, select <userinput>002 (Two-Step Posting)</userinput> as the value of the <uicontrol>Procedure Type</uicontrol> field.
In this case, you need to fill in the required information for the first step of the two-step posting in the <uicontrol>Bank Subaccount</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Journal Entry Type for Bank Subaccount</uicontrol> fields.
Asset Transactions
Shows acquisition and retirement information.

Specify the four-figure ABBL bank code in this field.
Latest Statement
Display the very latest bank statement of a house bank account.
Use
You can use this field to filter your search results for the latest bank statements that you have received from your house bank accounts.
If you leave all other filters blank and set the value of this field to <uicontrol>Latest only</uicontrol>, you can see as many bank statements as you have house bank accounts because only the most recent one of each house bank account is displayed.
If you select one house bank account and set the value of this field to <uicontrol>Latest only</uicontrol>, you can see only one result, which is the latest bank statement of the selected house bank account.
This filter displays the bank statement that entered the system <emphasis>at the latest date</emphasis>.
It does not refer to the bank statement number.
However, if there are multiple bank statements with the same date, the system considers the statement with the highest <emphasis>number</emphasis> and displays it as the search result.
Unconfirmed Maintenance Orders
These orders have at least one unconfirmed operation with a planned end date in the past.
This card shows you how many maintenance orders have at least one unconfirmed operation with a planned end date in the past 6 months.
This means that completion of the operation is still awaiting confirmation.
The orders are sorted by processing status.
The processing status for an order is set according to the lowest processing status of its order operations.
For example, if an order has several order operations with a planned end date in the past, and one operation has the processing status <uicontrol>Due</uicontrol>, the processing status for the order is <uicontrol>Due</uicontrol>.
Click the card header to see all unconfirmed orders and operations with a planned end date in the past 6 months.
Click a section in the chart to see unconfirmed orders and operations that have a specific processing status.

Document Status
Status of the budget document
Status of the budget document.
The status of the budget document can be as follows:
Initial
The data from the budget document hasn't been posted.
<emphasis>Posted</emphasis>:
The data from the budget document has been written to the database and it isn't possible to edit the related budget items.
<emphasis>Reversal</emphasis>:
A reversing entry that is generated when a posting is reversed.
In a reversing entry, the debit line items are identical to the credit line items in the previous entry, and the credit line items are identical to the debit line items in the previous entry.
<emphasis>Reversed</emphasis>:
When a document is reversed, its status changes from <uicontrol>posted</uicontrol> to <uicontrol>reversed</uicontrol>.
The status of the initial posting document changes to <uicontrol>Reversed</uicontrol>.
Additionally, a new document is generated with the status <uicontrol>Reversal</uicontrol> when a document is successfully reversed.
The two documents (Reversed and Reversal) reference each other in the <uicontrol>Reversal Reference Number</uicontrol> field.
Compensation Method
Specifies whether the account pays charges and taxes due to the bank.
Definition
Specifies whether the account pays charges and taxes due to the bank, and if so, how they are paid.
It can be either of the following methods:
<sap-technical-name>NOCP</sap-technical-name> (<uicontrol>No</uicontrol>):
The account does not pay any charges due.
Some other account in the hierarchy is debited or invoiced for charges and taxes due.
<sap-technical-name>DBTD</sap-technical-name> (<uicontrol>Debited</uicontrol>):
This account was debited for charges or taxes due.
<sap-technical-name>INVD</sap-technical-name> (<uicontrol>Invoiced</uicontrol>):
The account or its summary account was invoiced for charges and taxes due.
<sap-technical-name>DDBT</sap-technical-name> (<uicontrol>Delayed Debit</uicontrol>):
The account will be automatically debited on a future date
In a hierarchical structure, charging typically occurs only at a specific level.
For example, if all lowest level detail accounts are charged at the detail level, then the higher level accounts or summary accounts present the totals of the charges and taxes that occurred at the detail level.
If detail account charges are totaled or calculated at an intermediate level and charged at that level, then the higher level accounts or summary accounts present the totals of the charges and taxes that occurred at the intermediate level.
There should be no recalculation of charges and actual debiting or invoicing at levels above where the actual charging occurs.
Processing Order
Sequence in which conditions are executed.
You can define the sequence in which conditions are executed.
The more granular conditions (with more filters) always have to be executed before the more broadly defined conditions, which serve as a fallback.
This means you can create one condition that doesn’t have any filters.
This condition has to be the last one on the list.
As condition number 1 in the sequence of conditions, you define plant <userinput>A</userinput> from company <userinput>B</userinput> to trigger the situation instance.
As condition 2, you define plant <userinput>B</userinput> from company <userinput>B</userinput>.
As condition 3, you define only a company <userinput>B</userinput>.

Log Details
Provides an in-depth log of the substitution or validation execution.
The log detail page provides an in-depth log of the substitution or validation execution in runtime applications.
The list of messages illustrates in a tree-like structure the processing flow when a set of rules for a specific event is triggered.
Each log includes the following information from top to bottom:
A line depicting the event being processed, such as <sap-technical-name>FINS_ACC_CB_1</sap-technical-name> for <uicontrol>Coding Block</uicontrol>.
A line indicating the input document the substitution or validation applies to, such as <sap-technical-name>COBL</sap-technical-name> for <uicontrol>Coding Block</uicontrol> and <sap-technical-name>ACDOCU</sap-technical-name> for <uicontrol>Group Reporting Journal Entries</uicontrol>.
Substitution or validation rule content structured in a way that illustrates the internal processing flow of the rule execution.
The third column of this part additionally shows an excerpt of the substitution or validation script, which represents the rule in the backend execution.
The rule execution result, for example, if the precondition was met, which fields were subject to validation or substitution, was the validation successful or the substitution executed.
Log lines formatted in gray color are less important and are included simply for completeness reasons.

You can see metrics for damage and corrective activities in the chart and you can navigate to more details by setting drill downs.
With this, the values for the selected dimensions are added to the chart as additional columns.
Under <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol>, you can select and deselect dimensions and also measures of your chart, sort the object part code groups, and filter dimensions.
The table provides you navigation targets to further examine the technical object and notification of damage.
Amongst other things, it displays the amount of damage, damage code group and damage code and it lists damage based on notification items.
Limit Items
Enables you to create limit items for unplanned services or materials.
You can create limit items for unplanned services or for unplanned materials, that is, services or materials that cannot be specified in detail at the time of ordering.
In both cases, you define an expected value, an overall limit and a period of time:
Limit for materials:
Select <uicontrol>Product Type Group</uicontrol><cite>Material (1)</cite>
In case of a limit item for materials, a goods receipt is not possible.
The invoice is posted directly with reference to the purchase order, provided that the specified value limit is not exceeded.
Limit for lean services:
Select <uicontrol>Product Type Group</uicontrol><cite>Service (2)</cite>
In case of a limit item for services, a service entry sheet <emphasis>can</emphasis> be created if required.
It is also possible to post an invoice immediately.
If you record the performed services and their price and quantity using the <uicontrol>Manage Service Entry Sheets - Lean Services</uicontrol> app, the system displays the <uicontrol>Expected Value</uicontrol> of the limit item in the service entry sheet and reports an error if the stated amount exceeds the <uicontrol>Overall Limit</uicontrol>.
When creating a purchase order with limit items (item category E), the account assignment categories C, K, P, S, N, A, F, and U are currently supported.
You can view purchase order confirmations for limit items on the confirmation tab of the item.
Integrating Data From SAP HDI Containers
Access SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure (HDI) containers through <pname conkeyref="loio355f3590b9984e58929515541d44e10e/SAP-DWC-LONG"/> and use your data in the <uicontrol>Data Builder</uicontrol> or gain access to your space data from your HDI container.
What's an HDI container?
The SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure, or HDI for short, provides a service that enables you to deploy database development artifacts to so-called containers.
This service describes the deployed (run-time) state of SAP HANA database artifacts, for example: tables, views, or procedures, which have been created or adjusted by the SAP Integrated Development Environment (WebIDE) editors as a family of consistent design-time artifacts for all key SAP HANA platform database features.
These artifacts are modeled, staged (uploaded), built, and deployed into SAP HANA Cloud.
For more information on the SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure, see <xref format="html" href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/c2cc2e43458d4abda6788049c58143dc/cloud/en-US/4077972509f5437c85d6a03e01509417.html" scope="external">SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure (HDI) Reference</xref>.
Why would you need to access HDI containers?
If you already have HDI containers and would like to use existing data models in your <pname conkeyref="loio355f3590b9984e58929515541d44e10e/SAP-DWC-LONG"/> environment you can easily make them accessible in your space.
You can then work with the models by enriching them or using them for a Story.
You could also allow your space data to be consumed in your HDI containers.
Then you can work with the models that you created in <pname conkeyref="loio355f3590b9984e58929515541d44e10e/SAP-DWC-LONG"/> within your HDI environment.
What are the prerequisites?
The following roles need to be assigned to your HDI container:
<codeph>DWC_CONSUMPTION_ROLE</codeph> - e.g select on the required tables
<codeph>DWC_CONSUMPTION_ROLE#</codeph> - this role has all the privileges from <codeph>DWC_CONSUMPTION_ROLE</codeph>, but with the additional grantable option
How to acces your HDI containers?
There are a few steps you need to take if you want to access your HDI container or if you want your HDI container to consume the models and data from your space.
For both scenarios, you need to create an SAP ticket so we can map your HDI container with your <pname conkeyref="loio355f3590b9984e58929515541d44e10e/SAP-DWC-LONG"/> space.
For a simple step-by-step guide to get started see <xref format="html" href="https://help.sap.com/viewer/69221ae34e4244829841d6fe557d68e4/CLOUD/en-US/a94e1637db484a5c8ec2da83cfa75156.html" scope="external">Mapping your HDI Container to your Space</xref>.
Privileges
List the current available user privileges with the following statement <codeph>select * from effective_privileges where user_name = current_user;</codeph>:
The HDI role is granted to the <pname conkeyref="loio355f3590b9984e58929515541d44e10e/SAP-DWC-LONG"/> users when atached to a space
The database user consumes the data in the HDI container

View the overall structure of a selected bill of material.
Use
On choosing the <uicontrol>Explode BOM</uicontrol> button, the <uicontrol>Selection Criteria for BOM Explosion</uicontrol> dialog box appears.
You can define the following selection criteria to ensure that your BOM explosion only contains the information you require:
<uicontrol>Alternative BOM</uicontrol>
Specify the alternative if you want to explode a specific or a particular BOM.
By default, the app autodetermines the alternative BOM based on the valid from date.
<uicontrol>BOM Application</uicontrol>
By entering a BOM Application, you can target your explosion of a BOM for one specific area within the company (such as sales).
<uicontrol>Required Quantity</uicontrol>
If the BOM is a multiple BOM, you see the alternative for the lot-size range that corresponds to the required quantity.
If you do not enter a required quantity, the base quantity is automatically the required quantity.
<uicontrol>Valid From</uicontrol>
You must enter a valid-from date if you have processed the material BOM several times with change numbers that have a valid-from date defining their effectivity.
By default, the system uses the current date.
If you enter a change number, the system determines the valid-from date from the change master record.
<uicontrol>Change Number</uicontrol>
If you enter a change number, you display the alternative of the BOM that is effective for this change number.
<uicontrol>Additional Parameters</uicontrol>
In this section, you define the following:
<uicontrol>Assembly</uicontrol>
By entering an assembly, you restrict the display of the BOM explosion list to the entered assembly.

If this option is selected and usage data is applied, all productively used customer code is automatically considered as <uicontrol>In Scope</uicontrol> by default.
This means, all <emphasis>productively used</emphasis> custom code is migrated to <pname conkeyref="loiob430775feaca45b7b4a868915c73b512/SAP-S4HANA"/>.
If this option is selected and <emphasis>no</emphasis> usage data is applied, <emphasis>all</emphasis> customer code is considered as <uicontrol>In Scope</uicontrol>.
This means, <emphasis>all</emphasis> custom code is migrated to <pname conkeyref="loiob430775feaca45b7b4a868915c73b512/SAP-S4HANA"/>.
<uicontrol>New Implementation</uicontrol> for using a new <pname conkeyref="loiob430775feaca45b7b4a868915c73b512/SAP-S4HANA"/> system in which you want to transfer a subset of your custom code.
If this option is selected, <emphasis>no</emphasis> custom code is considered as <uicontrol>In Scope</uicontrol>.
This means, you must select the custom code which you want to transfer to <pname conkeyref="loiob430775feaca45b7b4a868915c73b512/SAP-S4HANA"/>.
Regardless of the selected transition scenario, you can adapt the scope in the <sap-technical-name translate="yes">Custom Code Migration</sap-technical-name> app.
Maintenance Backlog Card
Contains a stacked bar chart that provides you with information about backlogs.
You can view the details of the maintenance backlogs in any of these categories:
By Phase
By Maintenance Activity Type
By Order Type

If you select the dimension <uicontrol>By Phase</uicontrol> from the dropdown list and then click on the relevant colored bar, the system directs you as follows:
If you click on the maintenance requests in the <emphasis>Initiation</emphasis> phase or in the <emphasis>Screening</emphasis> phase, you navigate to the <uicontrol>Display Maintenance Notifications</uicontrol> app.
If you click on the maintenance orders that are in the <emphasis>Planning</emphasis> phase or in the <emphasis>Approval</emphasis> phase, you navigate to the <uicontrol>Maintenance Orders and Notifications</uicontrol> app.
If you click on the maintenance orders that are in the <emphasis>Preparation</emphasis> phase, you navigate to a pre-filtered list of orders in preparation in the <uicontrol>Manage Maintenance Backlog</uicontrol> app.
If you click on the maintenance orders that are in the <emphasis>Scheduling</emphasis> phase and if you use <cite>Resource Scheduling</cite>, you navigate to the <uicontrol>Manage Work Center Utilization</uicontrol> app and you can dispatch the maintenance order operations individually.
You are only directed to this resource scheduling app if you have assigned the performing work center of at least one of the maintenance order operations to your user in the resource scheduling apps.
If you click on the maintenance orders in the <emphasis>Execution</emphasis> phase or any other subsequent phase, you are directed to the <uicontrol>Maintenance Orders</uicontrol> app.
Edit Default Basic Information
Review and edit over defaulted basic information provided.
Step 5 begins by reviewing the <uicontrol>Handover Date</uicontrol> field.
This field is defaulted to the current date and the <uicontrol>Return by</uicontrol> date field will be a default number of days, defined in customizing (e.g. 30 days for default document type e-bgs), after the handover date.
You can change the <uicontrol>Handover Date</uicontrol> field manually or by choosing the calendar icon.
If you choose a new handover date, the return by date will automatically update.
The <uicontrol>Status</uicontrol> field is defaulted to <uicontrol>New</uicontrol>.
You can change the status while in <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> mode.
Valuation Category
Defines when the valuation takes place and whether it is reset.
Use
Defines the period in which the valuation takes place and whether the valuation is reset.
The following valuation categories are supported:
<uicontrol>Year-End Valuation</uicontrol>:
The positions are valued in accordance with the assigned position management procedure, and the relevant valuation flows are generated.
<uicontrol>Mid-Year Valuation with Reset</uicontrol>:
In addition to the valuation flows, reset flows are generated for the day following the valuation key date.
You can therefore see the effects of the valuation only on the valuation key date.
<uicontrol>Mid-Year Valuation Without Reset</uicontrol>:
This works in the same way as the year-end valuation.
Materials with Invalid Source

Then check under <uicontrol>Issues</uicontrol> the issue category <uicontrol>No Valid Source</uicontrol> and view more details about the specific material with no valid source of supply.
For example, you can see in which week or month the source of supply is missing and procurement won't be possible.
<uicontrol>Simulation Components</uicontrol>
Open the <uicontrol>Materials</uicontrol> perspective and pand the table row of the components to see, if there are components with no valid source.
Change the perspective to <uicontrol>Supply</uicontrol> and check, if there are anonymous suppliers.
Due Maintenance Orders
See how many orders in your work centers are due in the next 4 weeks.
The <uicontrol>Due Maintenance Orders by Priority</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Due Maintenance Orders</uicontrol> cards show you how many maintenance orders in your work centers are due in the next four weeks.
Both cards show the same data.
If you want to hide one of the cards, open the user actions menu in the top left corner of the screen and click <uicontrol>Manage Cards</uicontrol>.
By default, the cards show maintenance orders for all of your work centers, grouped by priority.
You can use filters to show the data that you are interested in.
Orders are taken into account if the following applies:
The order has at least one due operation in one of your work centers.
The planned dates for the operation fall in the display time period:
Either the planned start or the planned end date falls in the display time period.
Both dates fall in the display time period.
The operation starts before the display time period and ends after the display time period.
Click the card header to see all due orders and operations that are in one of your work centers.
Click a row in the table or a bar in the chart to see due orders and operations that have a specific priority.
Migrate Set-Based Groups
Considerations for migrating set-based groups.
When migrating set-based groups, such as activity type groups, please note the following:
Migration of groups can't be transported between systems.
Therefore, the migration must be done separately in both quality and production systems.
For a 3-system landscape, the migration needs to be repeated in development, test, and production systems.
During migration, the applications or configurations that use the groups (<emphasis>where-used list</emphasis>) are automatically updated to the new hierarchies.
Note that some group usages are configurations, for example the activity type groups used in <uicontrol>Define Splitting Structures</uicontrol>, the changes to them need to be executed in quality system and transported to production system.
To ensure consistency, SAP recommends you to migrate groups in all relevant systems and then release the transport requests for configurations.
Group ID can't exceed 15 characters.
Please pay special attention to the <emphasis>groups with subnodes</emphasis>, because during the migration, a subgroup is automatically generated for each subnode.
The subgroup ID is comprised of the new parent group ID, the special character "~", and subnode ID and tends to be long.
Therefore, avoid specifying long IDs as new group IDs.
Reporting Activity
Steps to be performed to complete the end-to-end reporting process
Definition
Reporting activities are steps that need to be performed to complete the end-to-end compliance reporting process.

Remainder Handling
Remainder handling for partial allocation by distribution
Definition
Determines how the rule-based account assignment distribution handles a partial allocation of an account assignment.
Use
In some circumstances, the account assignment distribution may only be able to allocate part of the original amount according to the distribution rule.
In these cases, this field determines how the remainder is allocated:
<i>Allocate to original account assignment</i>:
The remainder is allocated to the original account assignment and is entered by the user.
<i>User must allocate to new line</i>:
The user must allocate the remainder manually by creating a new account assignment line.
Value Group Type
Indicates whether the value group contains is continuous or discrete values
The type of a value group can be as follows:
Continuous:
The value group contains group values with continuous (numeric) values.
Discrete:
The value group contains group values with discrete values.

Business Catalog
Displays all models you are authorized to use.
In the Business Catalog, you can find the right model to create a story for analysis thanks to the semantic layer, its descriptions, its tags, and the assignment of a business use.
The Business Catalog gives an overview of all the models you can use, across all the Spaces you are authorized for.
When there are too many models, not all the models are shown at once.
You can load more models by choosing <uicontrol>Show more</uicontrol> at the end of the list.
The models are grouped using the following categories:
analytical datasets:
An analytical dataset is data that indicates a specific transaction, like the sale of a product.
Analytical datasets can be used for stories.
dimensions:
Dimensions are used to group data whose content is logically connected.
The customer dimension could, for example, be made up of the customer number, the customer group and the levels of the customer hierarchy.
relational datasets:
A relational dataset is the basic format of a model.
perspectives:
Perspectives can be used in stories.
By default, you see your object’s business name.
If you want to see the technical name instead of the business name, choose <menucascade><uicontrol>Your user icon</uicontrol><uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol><uicontrol>UI Settings</uicontrol><uicontrol>Show Technical Name</uicontrol></menucascade> .
You can use the following functions:
Search for Objects
You can either view all models or browse by relational dataset, dimension, analytical dataset, or perspective.
You can search for your objects using fuzzy search.
If you have defined tags for your objects, you can also search for these.
Create New Objects
You can create new objects directly from the Business Catalog so that you can continuously work even if entities are not found in the Catalog.
Choose <sap-icon-font conkeyref="loiob6f74c490ee5467b8efef730b03675de/tool_create"><sap-icon-font-size/><sap-icon-font-color/><sap-icon-background-color/><sap-icon-font-character/><sap-icon-font-description/></sap-icon-font> on the toolbar.

This means, this app is running in the same system as your custom code is located.
My Views
Choose predefined page variants or create your own ones.
Definition
Helps you manage (save, load, and delete) customized view and filter settings efficiently.
A page variant consists of a customized screen layout and predefined filter settings.
Use
You can use the following predefined page variants:
Sales Orders with Deliveries
This variant filters all sales orders for which deliveries have been created.
In addition, delivery-related filters and table columns are displayed by default.
Sales Orders with Failed Athorizations
This variant filters all sales orders in which the payment card status is set to <uicontrol>Not Approved</uicontrol>.
Sales Orders with Preauthorizations
This variant filters all sales orders in which the payment card is preauthorized.
Sales Orders without Deliveries
This variant filters all sales orders for which no deliveries have been created.
You can also create your own page variants.
After you’ve configured all aspects of your screen (filter selection, filter values, displayed columns, column sort order, and so on.) to your liking, you can save time by saving this exact screen configuration as a view variant and loading it back up any time you want.
If you want, you can set this view variant to load by default when you open the app.
You can also share saved views with other users.
Evaluation Period
Enter single evaluation dates or an evaluation period.
Definition
In the <uicontrol>Evaluation Period</uicontrol> field, you can either enter an evaluation period or one or multiple single evaluation dates.
The evaluation date is the date on which the market data and financial objects are selected and on which the market risk key figures are calculated.
Use
The system used the entered evaluation period/evaluation dates together with the chosen market risk key figures set, to identify the deletion relevant market risk key figure values.
Run Ledger
Ledger to which the allocations will be posted.
Definition
The selected allocation cycle is a flexible run cycle.
A flexible ledger cycle is one in which you have selected the <uicontrol>Flexible Ledger</uicontrol> checkbox when creating or editing the cycle.
Use
An allocation cycle is always defined for a specific ledger.
Selecting the flexible ledger checkbox in the cycle header allows you to choose to post to a different ledger or ledgers when you execute the cycle later during the course of business.
In the <uicontrol>Run Allocations</uicontrol> app, list the ledgers you wish to post to in <uicontrol>Run Ledger</uicontrol> when you execute the cycle.
Delivery Organization
Choose an organization to search for and staff resources.
Definition
Defines the organization from which resources can be staffed.
Use
You use delivery organizations to manage cross-location staffing, or strategic planning for reasons such as project budget or resource availability.
If you select a delivery organization, you can search for and staff resources only from the cost centers assigned to the specified organization.
If you do not select a delivery organization, you can search for and staff resources from any of the delivery organizations that belong to the same company code as the project's service organization.
When a resource is assigned to a role, the delivery organization of the resource is automatically filled.
To enable the system to search for resources, you must ensure that cost centers are assigned to relevant service organizations.
You can manage these assignments in the app <uicontrol>Maintain Service Organizations</uicontrol>.
Currency Pair
Dependent on the quotation type configured.
Use
Currency pairs are dependent on the quotation type configured.
Quotations can be either direct or indirect.
An exchange rate according to the direct quotation method gives the price in the <uicontrol>To Currency</uicontrol> that you have to pay for a unit (10, 100,...) of the <uicontrol>From Currency</uicontrol>.
An exchange rate according to the indirect quotation method gives the amount of the <uicontrol>From Currency</uicontrol> that you get for a unit (10, 100,...) of the <uicontrol>To Currency</uicontrol>.
Average Daily Usage
Selected by default to calculate the Average Daily Usage, which is necessary for calculating buffer proposals
This option is selected by default to calculate the Average Daily Usage (ADU), which is necessary for calculating buffer proposals.
ADU is the average usage of a product or component on a daily basis, calculated based on the demand over a selected averaging interval.
ADU is calculated based on one of the following options:
<uicontrol>Based on Fixed Interval</uicontrol>:
With this option, the ADU is calculated as the average consumption of goods issues in the past.
<uicontrol>Based on Rolling Interval</uicontrol>:
With this option, the ADU is calculated on each day.
Aging Report
Data in the <uicontrol>Aging Report</uicontrol> table might be limited.
Definition
The <uicontrol>Aging Report</uicontrol> table at the bottom of the app shows the outstanding payment amount to suppliers.
All open payments, whether already or not yet overdue, can be displayed.
Use
For readability and performance reasons, by default the table is limited to a maximum of 500 rows and 60 columns.
You can display more data if you want, but please note that the more cells you include, the longer it takes to load the app.
For more information about how to define the number of rows or columns to display, see the <uicontrol>Editing the Drill Limitation</uicontrol> section in the topic <xref keyref="loiofc4a548fca2b4a0998985e1411317431"/>.
Segment Hierarchy
The hierarchy for hierarchical consolidation based on segments.
Enter the segment hierarchy you defined using the <uicontrol>Manage Global Accounting Hierarchies</uicontrol> app.
It provides a consolidation view along this segment hierarchy by populating the <uicontrol>Segment Eliminated</uicontrol> reporting dimension.
Later, in report filter, you should choose the same hierarchy in the <uicontrol>Segment Eliminated</uicontrol> field to obtain meaningful hierarchy elimination results.
This field is optional.
Enter <sap-technical-name translate="no">$</sap-technical-name> to deselect any segment hierarchy.
Duplicated
Lists the uploaded items whose IDs already exist in the target system.
Lists the rules, methods, and selections that are uploaded from the spreadsheet and have IDs identical with the existing ones in your current system.
The existing items may have the <uicontrol>Active</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Draft</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Inactive</uicontrol> status.
Therefore, you need to compare the duplicates and decide if you want to skip the uploaded items or to import them so that the existing items are overwritten.
If you choose to import the duplicated items anyway, only the draft version of existing items are overwritten because all the imported items have an initial status <uicontrol>Draft</uicontrol>.
However, the subsequent <uicontrol>Mass Activation</uicontrol> action can activate these imported items and overwrite the existing active rules, methods, or selections.
More Actions
Displays the actions that are performed for purchase requisition items.
Use
Allows you to perform the following actions for purchase requisition items:
<uicontrol>Defer Purchase Requisitions</uicontrol>:

The closed purchase requisition item is not considered for materials planning.
<uicontrol>Reassign Purchasing Group</uicontrol>:
Enables you to reassign a purchasing group to purchase requisition items to facilitate central purchasers to transfer the workload from one purchasing group to other based on personnel availability.
Copy Team
Copy team information
To create a new team using the details of an existing team, choose <uicontrol>Copy</uicontrol>.
You can copy the responsibility definitons and team members to a new team.
The <uicontrol>Copy</uicontrol> action can be used to copy only one team.
You should specify a team name and description as the rest of the information is copied from the selected team.
The status of the new team is set to <uicontrol>Not Ready to Use</uicontrol>.
This action is available only to authorized users.
Copy to Company Code
Copies one or more G/L accounts from one company code to another in a batch.
Use
<uicontrol>Copy to Company Code</uicontrol> is available only when you are in the company code view.
The G/L accounts that you select for mass copy each time must be in the same chart of accounts and assigned with the same company code.
Otherwise you can't perform the mass copy.
To view the copy result, choose <uicontrol>View Log</uicontrol> in the upper right corner of the user interface after the copy is finished.
Network Graph
Visual representation of the allocation results
The tab displays a table view by default, but you can also switch to a <uicontrol>Network Graph</uicontrol> view.
The network graph is a visual representation of the allocation run.
You see a structure with senders on the left and receivers on the right.
You can use the functions within the network graph view to filter by certain characteristics and group different object types.
This is particularly useful in more complicated allocation runs.
For example, when performing a margin analysis allocation to profitability segments.
You can also click on different elements within the network graph to display more information about the object or interaction.
Plan Cost Credit
Sum of the planned costs with which cost objects were credited.
Use
For a description of how this is used, refer to the documentation for <xref keyref="loio6ae07f57e5705c08e10000000a441470" type="">Total Plan Cost</xref>.
The following columns are also used in Total Plan Cost:
<uicontrol>Plan Cost Debit</uicontrol>
Sum of the planned costs with which cost objects were debited.
<uicontrol>Plan FxdCst CR</uicontrol>
Fixed part of the planned cost credit.
<uicontrol>Plan FxdCst DR</uicontrol>
Fixed part of the planned cost debit.
Plan costs are updated based on the result of material standard cost.
Payment Clearing Group ID
Groups your suppliers and customers.
Definition
A payment clearing group is an attribute with which you can categorize your suppliers and customers into groups.
In the <uicontrol>Manage Bank Statement Reprocessing Rules</uicontrol> app, you can use the attribute as a condition of the reprocessing rule.
That means, with the <uicontrol>Payment Clearing Group</uicontrol> attribute, you have another option to actively influence the processing of your bank statement items.
The advantage of this attribute is that you can refer to certain business partners in one condition by using the correct payment clearing group.
Use
Your configuration expert can create and maintain your payment clearing groups in the <uicontrol>Manage Your Solution</uicontrol> app, under <menucascade><uicontrol>Configure Your Solution</uicontrol><uicontrol>Finance</uicontrol><uicontrol>Bank Accounting</uicontrol><uicontrol>Electronic Bank Statement</uicontrol><uicontrol>Define Payment Clearing Groups</uicontrol></menucascade>.
You can then assign the different payment clearing groups to your business partners in their master data.
Reason Code
Shows the reason for a payment difference
Definition
Shows the reason for a payment difference.
Use
You can use reason codes for the following:
To create a residual item for the payment difference
In this case, the original open item is cleared, and a new open item is created.
This new open item is linked to the original open item via the <uicontrol>Invoice Reference</uicontrol> field.
You can either enter your own short text to explain the reason or use a predefined reason code.
Note that you must use a reason code for which the <uicontrol>Charge Off</uicontrol> indicator has <emphasis>not</emphasis> been set.
The reason code is displayed for the new open item.
To charge off the payment difference via a separate G/L account
In this case, the original open item is cleared, and the payment difference is charged off as an expense or revenue to a separate G/L account.
Note that you must use a reason code for which the <uicontrol>Charge Off</uicontrol> indicator has been set.
The accounts to which differences are posted can be defined in the <uicontrol>Configure Your Solution</uicontrol> app under <menucascade><uicontrol>Finance </uicontrol><uicontrol>General Ledger </uicontrol><uicontrol>Chart of Accounts </uicontrol><uicontrol>Automatic Account Determination</uicontrol></menucascade>.
Reason codes can be defined in the <uicontrol>Configure Your Solution</uicontrol> app under <menucascade><uicontrol>Finance </uicontrol><uicontrol>Accounts Receivable </uicontrol><uicontrol>Incoming Payments </uicontrol><uicontrol>Define Reason Codes (Manual Outgoing Payments) </uicontrol></menucascade>.
Set Billing Block
You can block sales orders for billing.
You can set billing blocks for sales orders on header level.

You want to apply a billing block to certain documents so that prices can be checked before further processing.
Use Opening Balance
Defines whether opening balance should be used.
Opening balance is the balance of all account entries just before the selected document was posted.
The opening balance equals the closing balance that was carried forward from the previous document posting.
The opening balance is calculated relative to the accounting period specified in the <uicontrol>Document Range</uicontrol> filter.
When <uicontrol>Use Opening Balance</uicontrol> is set to <uicontrol>Yes</uicontrol>, an aggregated opening balance is displayed for all entries posted to the account before the selected document was posted.
When <uicontrol>Use Opening Balance</uicontrol> is set to <uicontrol>No</uicontrol>, no opening balance is displayed.
Instead, you can see individual entries posted to the account since the beginning of the accounting period specified in the <uicontrol>Document Range</uicontrol> filter.
Send Email
Sends correspondence as an email attachment.
To send correspondence as an email attachment:
Choose <uicontrol>Send Email</uicontrol>.
Type the email address of the recipient into the <uicontrol>To</uicontrol> field.
You can add several recipients.

Write Off
Write off billing amounts, which are due for <uicontrol>Time and Expenses</uicontrol> items.
Use
To write off amounts associated with <uicontrol>Time and Expenses</uicontrol> items:
On the <uicontrol>To Be Billed</uicontrol> tab, select one or more items as required and choose <uicontrol>Write Off</uicontrol>.
Confirm the write-off action and verify that the selected items have moved from the <uicontrol>To Be Billed</uicontrol> tab to the <uicontrol>To Be Written Off</uicontrol> tab.
The <uicontrol>To Be Billed</uicontrol> amount of the billing element, seen in the header section of the <uicontrol>Prepare Billing</uicontrol> page, gets updated with the new amount calculated as follows:
<uicontrol>To Be Billed</uicontrol> (after write-off) = <uicontrol>To Be Billed</uicontrol> (before write-off) - Amount written off
Where,
Amount written off = (Sum of (<uicontrol>Quantity to Be Written Off</uicontrol> * <uicontrol>Sales Rate</uicontrol>) for those items where <uicontrol>Quantity to Be Written Off</uicontrol> is not 0) + (Sum of <uicontrol>Cost to Be Written Off</uicontrol> for those items where <uicontrol>Quantity to Be Written Off</uicontrol> is 0)
Non-billable items are written off by default.
You can see these items on the <uicontrol>To Be Written Off </uicontrol> tab and verify that they're non-billable by looking at the <uicontrol>Billing Control Category</uicontrol> column.
These items cannot be included under <uicontrol>To Be Billed</uicontrol>.
After submitting the project billing request, the written off amounts cannot be brought back into any billing cycle.
Even if a billing clerk rejects the billing document request, the written off amounts continue to remain written off.

When a demand is closed, the related purchase requisition item is also flagged to be closed.
Automatic Posting Scenario
Business context for automatic postings.
Represents a business context where an intercompany matching and reconciliation process can trigger automatic postings, for example, elimination posting, adjustment posting, subledger clearing posting, and accrual posting.
It determines document header fields, control options, and document item fields that are available for defining posting rules.
SAP delivers the following automatic posting scenarios:
<sap-technical-name>SA001</sap-technical-name> (<uicontrol>Posting Adjustments for Accounting</uicontrol>)
<sap-technical-name>SC001</sap-technical-name> (<uicontrol>Elimination Postings for Group Reporting</uicontrol>)
User Group
The user group bundles technical users according to common characteristics.
Here you can define the required user group of your technical user.
There are several types of technical users that take on technical tasks in your system:
SAP Technical Users
These users are predefined by SAP to run operating tasks in the system.
SAP technical users are also required for customer-specific tasks, such as running and scheduling jobs.
The required job template contains the SAP technical user needed to run the job by default.
Communication Users
Communication users are technical users required for communication between your system and any integrated system.
The following types of communication users are available:
SAP communication users:
Predefined by SAP
Communication users :
Created by customers
Custom communication users are created in the <uicontrol>Maintain Communication Users</uicontrol> app and are assigned to systems for inbound and outbound communication.
These technical users either use basic authentication or certificates to communicate between your system and the integrated system.
The communication system, together with a communication scenario, is assigned to a communication arrangement.
Thus, all communication scenario roles are assigned to the communication user which provides this user with all permission required for the connection between your system and the integrated system.
Print Users
The print user is the technical user with which SAP Cloud Print Manager logs on to the system.
SAP Cloud Print Manager establishes the connection between print queues and local printers.
This user can be created in the <uicontrol>Maintain Print Queues</uicontrol> app.
Support Users
SAP uses support users to provide customers with support if issues occur in the system.
These users only exist temporarily and are deleted by SAP after the support process is completed.
TRM_RC_Facilities
Facilities are agreements between a lender and a borrower, which control the general conditions for a series of drawings against a credit line.
The lender can give drawing authorization to several people (= borrowers), who are entitled to draw varying amounts at any time up to the total approved credit line.
The utilization of this credit option for a facility is called a drawing.
The lender calculates charges for the borrower (commitment interest).
The charges that incur are calculated according to different methods.
Confirmed facilities
The lender guarantees the availability of a limited credit amount at any time.
The borrower has to pay a charge for this.
Unconfirmed facilities
The lender does not guarantee a credit limit.
No charges are made for this.
The functions for managing facilities include functions for creating and processing them.
You can assign deposits at notice, cash flow transactions and interest rate instruments to a facility.
You specify which money market transactions can be assigned as drawings on the<uicontrol> Rules</uicontrol> tab page.
For an overview of the transactions that have already been assigned to the facility, see the <uicontrol>Profiles</uicontrol> tab page.
Enter Manual Contract Accruals
Adjust the accruals
Allows you to adjust the accruals.
Manual accruals are overwritten by the next revaluation, that is, with either of the following:
The <uicontrol>Revalue</uicontrol> function in this app
A periodic revenue recognition run executed with the <uicontrol>Run Revenue Recognition – Service Documents</uicontrol> app.
The manual contract accruals function generates a source document.
Message Severity
Messages related to the import of compliance requirements.
When you specify a file for import, the app analyses its data and reports potential issues with it.
Then, if there are no severe issues that prevent the import, the data is recorded in the system.
Issues with severity <uicontrol>Error</uicontrol>, either caused by the details of the compliance requirement or the subordinate paragraphs, prevent the import of the entire compliance requirement.
To facilitate the correction of the import file, the app displays information about the skipped compliance requirements.
Issues with severity <uicontrol>Warning</uicontrol> do not prevent the import of the corresponding compliance requirements.
Assignment Time Period
Enter the date or time period for which to create an assignment.
If you choose the <uicontrol>Total Hours</uicontrol> rule or the <uicontrol>Daily Hours</uicontrol> rule, you can change the time period.
This is useful, for example, if you want to break the overall assignment down into different segments using different distribution rules.
However, make sure that the start and end dates of the assignment are within the resource request start and end dates.
You can also use the calendar to specify the assignment time period.
If you choose the <uicontrol>As Requested</uicontrol> rule, you cannot change the time period.
Where Does the Preset Time Period Come From?
Change Category
The change category indicates how a finding can be solved.
The following categories are available:
<uicontrol>Technical</uicontrol>:
The finding can be solved by performing technical changes in your custom code.
For example, a technical change can be a replacement of a <codeph>SELECT</codeph> statement with an API call to reach the same functionality as before.
<uicontrol>Functional</uicontrol>:
The finding can typically not be solved by performing technical changes.
To solve the functional finding, you might need to re-design the application.
<uicontrol>Not specified</uicontrol>:
It is not specified whether the required change to solve the finding is technical or functional.
Application Configuration
Configures the currency and exception rules for your app.
Use
For the app currency, you can choose either the controlling area currency or the company code currency.
The settings you make for exception rules influence the values shown in the <uicontrol>Exception Status</uicontrol> column in your result list.
The column can show a status of green, yellow or red status.
You can define the threshold and basic criteria for each status here.
In the <uicontrol>Rule Basis</uicontrol> field, choose the criteria for the rule, and whether it is triggered by a percentage value, an absolute value, or both.
Define the absolute or percentage thresholds for your rule and save your settings.
Services Rendered Date
Specify the date on which the services were provided
Use
You can use the services rendered date to specify the date on which the services were provided.
The system uses this date for tax calculation per billing request line.
By default, the system uses the billing date as the services rendered date.
For service contract items (item category <sap-technical-name>SCN1</sap-technical-name>), services rendered dates are displayed only.
For price adaptation (item category <sap-technical-name>SCN2</sap-technical-name>) and ad-hoc billing (item category <sap-technical-name>SCN3</sap-technical-name>), services rendered dates are editable.
What's Changed
Identifies what has changed in the compliance requirement.
Definition
Identifies what has changed in the compliance requirement, which could be one of the following:
<uicontrol>New Compliance Requirement</uicontrol>:
The first version of a new compliance requirement has been released.
<uicontrol>New Version</uicontrol>:
A new version of the existing compliance requirement has been released.
<uicontrol>Update of Existing Version</uicontrol>:
The existing compliance requirement version has been revised and released again.
Manage Scheduled Jobs
To change scheduled jobs
Use
If jobs have been scheduled for posting periods, you can change them by choosing this button.
Here's how you do it:
To change scheduled jobs, do the following:
Select a posting period variant for which a job has been scheduled (and is displayed in the <uicontrol>Scheduled Open Period</uicontrol> column).
Choose <uicontrol>Manage Scheduled Jobs</uicontrol>.
Select a job type and action (or all of them) and choose <uicontrol>Go</uicontrol>.
You can now delete the jobs that are displayed.
New Filter for Employee Responsible
Filter service contracts according to selected employee responsible.
Use
A new filter <uicontrol>Employee Responsible</uicontrol> is available to replace the old <uicontrol>Responsible Employee</uicontrol> filter, which is being deprecated.
In the value help of the new filter, all search results are restricted to the employees responsible for service contracts, excluding those with the business partner role <uicontrol>Employment</uicontrol>.
When the deprecated filter <uicontrol>Responsible Employee</uicontrol> is removed, it disappears from the customized filter settings.
You can add the new <uicontrol>Employee Responsible</uicontrol> filter to your filter settings in advance.
Assessment Progress
View the assessment progress on assessments with released successor.
Use
When a new version of a dangerous good regulation is activated, the system generates classification requests for the affected products.
For the new classification requests, there is no released successor available because the successor is created in status <uicontrol>In Progress</uicontrol>.
Therefore, the assessment progress section gives you an overview about how many products have been reassessed and their classification has been released.
Once the graphic indicates that all assessments have a released successor, the reassessment according to the new version of the dangerous goods regulation is completed.
If you select the blue part of the bar chart, the dangerous goods assessment list displays only assessments with a release successor available.
If you select the orange part of the bar chart, the dangerous goods assessment list displays only assessments without a release successor.
Matching Expression
For comparing the values calculated for the relevant data slices.
An equation defined using left- and right-hand matching fields, a comparison operator, and optionally, conversion functions.
Matching expressions are used for comparing the values calculated for the relevant data slices.
By default, when you choose the left-hand field, the same field on the right hand is selected automatically provided the second slice has the same field.
However, the two sides don't have to be with a same field but a same data type.
Matching expression is not needed for matching rules with the match type <uicontrol>Group as Assigned</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Group as Matched</uicontrol>.
And it is also not mandatory for the other three match types.
For example, if a matching rule with the type <uicontrol>Auto-Assign</uicontrol> doesn’t have any matching expressions, it means all the items filtered by the two slices are grouped under one assignment.
The <uicontrol>Function</uicontrol> column allows you to make conversions for the values of matching fields.
It is data-type-dependent, for example, we provide “<sap-technical-name translate="no">SUBSTRING</sap-technical-name>” for string-like fields and “<sap-technical-name translate="no">CONVERT_CURRENCY</sap-technical-name>” for amount-type fields.
Comparison operators are also data-type-dependent.
For numeric fields, “<sap-technical-name translate="no">OPPOSITE</sap-technical-name>” and “<sap-technical-name translate="no">TOLERANCE</sap-technical-name>” are available in addition to the common operators such as “=”, “>”, “<>” and so on.
All Payments
Make the payment available again in all users’ worklists
On this tab you can remove the processor from a payment to make the payment available again in all users’ worklists.
Use
In addition to the payments in your worklist, this tab also contains payments that are assigned to other users.
Usually you work only on payments in your worklist.
However, if a payment is assigned to another user who cannot finish it, open the <uicontrol>All Payments</uicontrol> tab and remove the user as the processor by clicking <image keyref="loio3d8223555e8b3e6ae10000000a44176d" placement="inline"><alt>Remove Processor</alt></image>.
The payment then becomes available in all users’ worklists and can be processed by another user.
Low-Level Code
Click to select the lowest level of a material in a BOM.
Use the value help to define the lowest material level that you want to include in your reference data for your simulation.
The low-level code is the lowest level that a material appears in any product structure of the company.
The low-level code controls the sequence in which the material is planned in an MRP run.
First the materials with low-level code <sap-technical-name>0</sap-technical-name> are planned, then the materials with low-level code <sap-technical-name>1</sap-technical-name>, and so on.
The lower the low-level code, the higher the number that is assigned to the material.
The low-level code is set in the material master record when the BOM is maintained.
Exchange Rate Type
A classification of exchange rates based on their use.
Exchange rates can be used as a buying rate, bank selling rate, or average rate.
The selected exchange rate type is used when translating or converting currency amounts.
The following exchange rate type is predefined in the system:
<uicontrol>M</uicontrol>- Standard translation at average rate
Other exchange rate types are:
<uicontrol>AVG</uicontrol> - Consolidation Monthly Average Rate
<uicontrol>CLO</uicontrol> - Consolidation Monthly Closing Rate
<uicontrol>P</uicontrol> - Standard translation for cost planning
Global ID
Team global identifier
A team global ID uniquely identifies a team across multiple systems.
For example, when you need to have the same team in production and quality systems, or any system or service which can store a team in responsibility management, you need a team global ID that is the same in all systems.
A team global ID cannot be empty, cannot be longer than 40 characters, and cannot be changed after it is saved.
When you create a team, the team global ID is automatically populated with a team name, after you enter a team name.
If needed, you can change a team's global ID before you save a team's definition.
For an existing team created in an earlier release, you need to enter a team global ID so that the team is available via <xref keyref="loiocedb8a76b15e49c29b1d79d421e4b57c"/> and <xref keyref="loiofdfc60cb8a5f40bcaa56a1c65acc8b28"/> ODATA APIs.
A team internal ID is generated automatically but is unique to the system in which it is created.
Therefore, if you need a reference to a team, SAP recommends that you persist the team global ID and not the team internal ID.
Expiration Date
Specifies the valid-to date of regulations, permits, and policies.
Definition
Specifies the <uicontrol>Valid To</uicontrol> date for compliance requirements.
Compliance requirements that have been replaced or revisioned and need your attention are color-coded as follows:
Compliance requirements whose expiration date is approaching are marked in yellow.
Compliance requirements whose expiration date has passed are marked in red.
Add from Regulation
Add data about substances with occupational exposure limits from the regulation.
Definition
Adds data about one or multiple substances with occupational exposure limits to the unpackaged product or raw material directly from the most recently activated <uicontrol>Health and Safety Management</uicontrol> regulation whose lists are assigned to the <uicontrol>Safety Data Sheet Management</uicontrol> regulation used for the compliance assessment.
Use
The system adds data about one or multiple substances with occupational exposure limits to the unpackaged product or raw material directly from the regulation.
Once a given substance with occupational exposure limits is already added to the unpackaged product or raw material, you cannot add it to it again.
Share Schedule
Add others as planners or reviewers.
To share the schedule, add one or more people as maintenance planners or reviewers.
Adding Someone as Maintenance Planner
All maintenance planners have full permissions and can modify, share, or delete the schedule.
Adding Someone as Reviewer
Reviewers have read-only access to the schedule and cannot see the utilization forecast shown when the schedule is in <uicontrol>Scoping</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Refinement</uicontrol>.
Reviewers do not require any work center assignment.
Revoking Access to the Schedule
To unshare the schedule, just remove the name of the person whose access you want to revoke.
Basic Description
If the product is a dangerous good, add a basic description.
Definition
Specifies a text describing the dangerous good.
Use
If you have classified the product as a dangerous good, you have to enter a dangerous good basic description.
When you choose the (+) <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol> icon, the system prefills the description with a text containing the values from the classification data.
You can change the description, if needed.
Admin Information
Header section of the situation type.
Displays the basic information of a situation type.
When you create a new situation type, enter an ID and a name.
You can change (overwrite) the name suggested for the copied situation template or situation type in the name field.
The ID of your situation type should start with a <userinput>Y</userinput> or <userinput>Z</userinput>. Make sure the ID doesn't contain special characters.
Under <uicontrol>Display Sequence</uicontrol>, you can define the sequence in which situations are displayed:
If multiple situation instances exist for a business object, they’re displayed on the object page according to the value for the display sequence.
Upload Cycles
Download and upload template for cycle and segment definitions.
Use
Use this function to download a preformatted CSV file template that you can use to create new allocation cycles and segments or edit existing ones.
After you have made your changes to the file, use the same function to upload the completed template.
When using this function:
You can only use it with the cost center and profit center allocation contexts.
You cannot edit the uploaded data within the <uicontrol>Manage Allocations</uicontrol> app.
If you want to make changes to data, then you must download the file again, make your changes, and then upload the file again.
You must enter cycle information on each sheet within the file.
The following fields must be completed and consistent on each sheet:
<uicontrol>Cycle ID</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Allocation Context</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Ledger</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Valid From</uicontrol>.
When entering data on the Senders and Receivers sheets within the file, specifying a <uicontrol>From Value</uicontrol> without specifying a <uicontrol>To Value</uicontrol> means you are entering a single value.
The order of the sheets within the file cannot be changed from the default order.
They must stay the same as they were when you downloaded the template.
On the <uicontrol>Description</uicontrol> sheet within the file, you can only use those values which are relevant to the context and universal allocation.
Overtime Category
Use this field to capture overtime.
Use
You can choose an <uicontrol>Overtime Category</uicontrol> to capture the time invested by service employees in addition to their planned working time.
Overtime is planned like regular working time.
When you use an <uicontrol>Overtime Category</uicontrol> for a service order item or service confirmation item, the price of the service increases.
If the <uicontrol>Overtime Category</uicontrol> is <field>Weekend</field>, the price of the service increases by 50%, if the surcharge is defined as 50%.
Service employees can change the <uicontrol>Overtime Category</uicontrol>.
For example, if a service employee works on a <field>Public Holiday</field> whereas the <uicontrol>Overtime Category</uicontrol> planned was <field>Weekend</field>, they can change the <uicontrol>Overtime Category</uicontrol>.
If you want to record unplanned overtime, you must create an additional service confirmation.
Review Finished
Lists accruals that have been manually or automatically reviewed.
Use
Accruals that have been successfully reviewed display on the Review Finished tab page.
The following accruals can be of status Review Finished:
Accruals that have been manually reviewed in this app
Accruals that have been automatically reviewed because the amounts are between the threshold range.
Accruals that have been manually reviewed in the <uicontrol>Review Purchase Order Accruals - My Inbox</uicontrol> app
As the review process is not required, you can post accruals directly that need reviewing but haven't been reviewed.
Auto-Match
To run matching based on the rules in the current matching method.
Choose the button to run auto match for your specified leading unit and partner units based on the method.
During the matching run, the <uicontrol>Assign</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Communicate</uicontrol>, and <uicontrol>Auto-Match</uicontrol> buttons are grayed out.
This is to prevent concurrent activities on the same data set and to avoid any data inconsistency.
Upon completion of the matching, the buttons are enabled again, and data refreshed.
For any existing assignment that has the reason code <uicontrol>Temporary Resolution</uicontrol> checkbox selected, the matching run unassigns and invalidates the assignment number, reads and rematches the latest data from the relevant data sources, refreshes the processing status, and triggers any follow-ups required by the reason code.
However, if the assignment is still in the process of automatic adjustment or approval workflow, the auto match run skips it.
Search Date
Select a search date or run a date-independent search.
Use
You can execute the search for any specific date to see recipes that are valid on that date, be it past, present, or future.
You can also decide to search recipes without specifying a search date by selecting the <uicontrol>Any Date</uicontrol> option.
If a search item is not present in a recipe throughout the recipe's entire validity, you will see a warning in the result list with details about the change.
If a specific search date has been selected, the system uses the selected search date as the recipe's key date when you navigate to a recipe directly from this app,.
You still have the possibility to change the key date in the <uicontrol>Calculation Parameters</uicontrol> window.
Add Resource
You can search for and staff people to a project.
Use
You use this function to search for employees or service performers and staff them to a work package.
The search is performed on all delivery organizations that belong to the company code of the project's service organization.
Hence, it is important that cost centers are assigned to their respective service organizations.
This function allows you to only staff someone who has been assigned at least once, with a definite role.
Use the <uicontrol>Add Role</uicontrol> function to staff employees or service performers who have never been assigned to a project.
Hidden Fields
Lets you select hidden fields.
Use
Here you can specify which fields not to use in the <xref keyref="loio45d60edcf02d409c87076f9270372eb8"/> app:

Introducing Tenant Configuration
Configure your tenant by allocating the capacity units based on your business needs.
Configuring your tenant is relevant for SAP Data Warehouse Cloud tenants that are deployed as of October 12, 2021.
You've logged into your <pname id="SAP-DWC-LONG">SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</pname> tenant for the first time and you need to allocate the capacity units to compute and storages resources.
According to your needs, you can keep or change the default provisioning of your tenant based on your contract.
Your contract includes a total number of available capacity units per month which you can allocate as you wish to the compute and storage resources.
As long as you have not configured the tenant, you can use only administration features of <pname>SAP Data Warehouse Cloud</pname> (but you cannot create spaces in the Space Management page).
Once you save the configuration of your tenant, you cannot change it.
The whole process may take more than 90 minutes.
Bank Statement Check Time
Time point for checking the import status of bank statements.
Definition
Specifies a time point for checking the import status of bank statements.
Use
The system evaluates the import status of bank statements after the specified time point and judges whether the import is finished successfully or not.
You can check the import status using the <uicontrol>Bank Statement Monitor</uicontrol> app.
Tax Calc. by Partner
Displays the tax information for this item as returned by your tax partner.
The <uicontrol>Tax Calculated by Partner</uicontrol> column displays the tax information as calculated and returned by your tax partner.
You can compare the information in this column with the corresponding information in the <uicontrol>Tax in Journal Entry</uicontrol> column.
The information in these two columns typically match, reflecting that the information was communicated in an <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol> call.
If the information in these two columns don’t match, then there was a discrepancy between what your SAP system calculated and what your tax partner returned.
This indicates that the successful update was a <uicontrol>Force Update</uicontrol>.
In the case of a <uicontrol>Force Update</uicontrol>, the <uicontrol>Tax Calculated by Partner</uicontrol> is provided for your information and reference.
Capacity Sequence Groups
Lists sequence groups for capacity allocations and their values.
The <uicontrol>Capacity Sequence Groups</uicontrol> subscreen lists sequence groups for capacity allocations for the product allocation sequence.
You can use a capacity sequence group as an alternative source of product allocation that is checked after a product availability check has been executed.
The confirmation from the preceding product availability check is the request (date and quantity) for the product allocation check against capacity.
If the available quantity in a capacity sequence group is insufficient to fulfill a requirement, the available quantity in the next capacity sequence group is also considered.
Like sales sequence groups, capacity sequence groups are consumed according to their priority.
Defaultable Business Partner
The defaultable counterparty of the bank.
Definition
The defaultable counterparty of the bank in the sense of IAS 32 and IFRS 7.
Use
You specify a defaultable business partner for banks when using bank reconciliation accounts in G/L account assignment.
The business partner assigned as a defaultable business partner must has the BP role of <uicontrol>Bank</uicontrol> (<sap-technical-name>TR0703</sap-technical-name>).
The attribute can be used to identify bank accounts that belong to the same defaultable counterparty.
For more information about G/L account assignment with bank reconciliation accounts, see <xref keyref="loio3247e8093a34431ab7423653835a1d8f">Assigning G/L Accounts to House Bank Accounts</xref>.

Use
The indicator is set automatically for an item when the total reserved quantity has been withdrawn or delivered.
You can also manually mark the item as completed using the <uicontrol>Complete Item</uicontrol> button, if no further goods movements are expected.
The corresponding attribute flag will be set automatically.
The completed item is available for further editing.
Create Tasks Manually
Create warehouse tasks for an item, specifying how much should be put away and where.
Use
Create warehouse tasks for a single delivery item.
In <uicontrol>Target Quantity</uicontrol>, you can see what quantity still needs to be put away using product warehouse tasks.
You can choose how much and where exactly in the warehouse it should be put away.
Alternatively, press <uicontrol>Create Tasks</uicontrol> to have the system create warehouse tasks for all items.
In this case, you do not manually specify quantity or storage destination.

You can select one of the following options:
<userinput>Billable</userinput>
The system calculates a planned revenue for such items.
In work packages that are billed against a time and expense contract, only billable postings are considered for billing.
<userinput>Non-billable</userinput>
The system does not calculate a planned revenue for such items.
Non-billable postings are automatically written off during billing.
Since the planned revenue is calculated based on this field, you must use the <uicontrol>Recalculate</uicontrol> button to view the updated amount.
You cannot change the value of this field if actuals have been posted for an item or if a resource is confirmed, or when the project is <uicontrol>In Execution</uicontrol>.
In a service-based work package, all resource items and expenses are non-billable by default since only the service is billed.
Products by Valuation

Set Parameters
Set parameters for data shown throughout this section of the app.
Data in this section is only shown for the time frame, plan category, and currency that you select here under <uicontrol>Set Parameters</uicontrol>.
The default is for the current fiscal period, order standard cost, and company code currency.
Note that the <uicontrol>Order Balance</uicontrol> shown on the opening screen of the app represents the total actual costs over the lifetime of the order so far, whereas the <uicontrol>Actl Cost.</uicontrol> value here is only for the time frame selected under <uicontrol>Set Parameters</uicontrol>.
You can adjust the parameters as required.
For the <uicontrol>Fiscal Year Period</uicontrol> fields, enter a year and period in the format YYYYPPP.
For example, for fiscal period 003 in year 2021, you would enter 2021003.
By selecting a different cost component structure, you change how the costs associated with the order are grouped under cost components.
Only cost component structures that are flagged as Cost of Goods Manufactured will be available.
Add Issuing Organization and Authority
Add an <uicontrol>Issuing Authority</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Issuing Organization</uicontrol> into the <uicontrol>Internal Information</uicontrol> area on the <uicontrol>Create Permit</uicontrol> screen.
Step 5 begins by either filling in the mandatory <uicontrol>Issuing Organization</uicontrol> field manually or by searching for business partners in the optional <uicontrol>Issuing Authority</uicontrol> field.
If you choose a business partner in the <uicontrol>Issuing Authority</uicontrol> field, this value will be copied into the <uicontrol>Issuing Organization</uicontrol> field.
For this to happen, you start by choosing the value help in the <uicontrol>Issuing Authority</uicontrol> field.
A popup will be displayed.
Use the <uicontrol>Search</uicontrol> field in the popup to search for all business partners or you can use the list available.
Once you have chosen a business partner, the <uicontrol>Issuing Authority</uicontrol> field will automatically be filled in and become read only.
For more information on these fields, please use the available <uicontrol>Help Topics</uicontrol> inside the app.
Kanban Indicator
Allows you to enable a Kanban process for items in a purchase scheduling agreement.
Use
The <uicontrol>Kanban Indicator</uicontrol> allows you to enable a Kanban process for items in a purchase scheduling agreement.
Kanban is a means of signaling the demand status for a certain material.
The replenishment or production of a material is not triggered until a certain production level needs the material.
The signal for replenishment is issued by an indicator, that is sent by a demand source (consumer) to the supply source (supplier).
Expiration Date
Auto expire memo records when the expiration date arrives.
You can set the <uicontrol>expiration date</uicontrol> for memo records that need to be automatically expired.
You create a memo record for an outgoing payment.
You set the payment date as the expiration date.
After this date, the memo record is automatically expired.
The status is then changed from active to inactive.
Placeholders
Select the placeholder that you want to use for the description.
Definition
Specifies variables that are used to generate the description in different languages.
Use
You can select a placeholder to use it for the description.
The placeholders are resolved in the languages in which the document is printed.
Please note that some placeholders, such as <<SHIPPED_QUANTITY>> and <<DG_BASIC_DESCRIPTION>>, can be resolved only in the sales and delivery process.
In addition to the use of placeholders, you can also enter text manually and change the formatting.
If you enter a text and you want to print documents in different languages, select a regulation and navigate to the <uicontrol>Classify Dangerous Good - Packaged Product</uicontrol> app.
In this app, you can enter the description in different languages.
Manage Your Data Products
Manage the data products you want to offer to your consumers.
For each data set that you want make available to consumers in the <uicontrol>Data Marketplace</uicontrol> app, you create a data product.
It contains data in an envelope with meaningful metadata which is displayed on the products detail page and is used for searching and browsing through the various data products.
When you create a data product, most of the metadata and information you enter will be visible for consumers.
It helps them to evaluate your data product and it can influence their buying decision.
As a data provider, you decide on the pricing model for a data product: a data product can be either free of charge or require the purchase of a license at a certain cost.
You also choose whether to ship your data products as one-time deliveries or as regularly updated versions.
Once you've created a data product, you list it to make it available to consumers.
Target Balance
Specifies the target account balance of this bank account.
Use
If the bank account is defined as a subaccount of a physical cash pool, you can define a target amount for this bank account.
Otherwise, this field is not relevant.
The target amount defines the target bank account balance for this bank account in cash concentration simulation.
According to the defined target amount and pool usage, the system proposes the cash concentration as follows:
When the account balance of the subaccount is greater than the target amount, and the cash pool is defined as <uicontrol>Both Direction</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Cash Concentration</uicontrol>, the system proposes to transfer money from the subaccount to the header account.
When the account balance of the subaccount is smaller than the target amount, and the cash pool is defined as <uicontrol>Both Direction</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Cash Distribution</uicontrol>, the system proposes to transfer money from the header account to the subaccount.
This value is for simulation only.
Users can edit the transfer amount according to their needs.
However, the <uicontrol>Minimum Transfer Amount</uicontrol> must be considered if it is defined.
Planned Count Date Interval
Defines the relative time interval to schedule a job for creating the PI documents.
Definition
Defines a <emphasis>relative</emphasis> time interval for which you want to determine the creation of the necessary physical inventory documents for your cycle counting process.
The <uicontrol>Planned Count Date Interval</uicontrol> based on a date function with a time-based value help for the days in the future.
You can only display and use this <uicontrol>Planned Count Date Interval</uicontrol> field when you use the date selection type <uicontrol>Relative</uicontrol>.
Use
A predefined value help supports you in choosing a value for the next x days in the future.
You can choose between <uicontrol>Next 1 day</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Next 180 days</uicontrol>.
You can maintain this predefined value help with your own values.
To do so, a user with the <uicontrol>Analytics Specialist</uicontrol> role can use the <uicontrol>Manage Date Functions</uicontrol> app.
You can use this app to define very flexible time options, for example, you can define <emphasis>last day of next week</emphasis>, <emphasis>first day of next month</emphasis>, and so on, as the end date.
Remove Constraints
Remove existing constraints for the selected order operations.
Remove existing date constraints for the selected order operations.
You can remove constraints for order operations that are not yet in process.
Enable the display of relationships and <uicontrol>Must start on</uicontrol> constraints for operations in the settings (<sap-icon-font><sap-icon-font-size/><sap-icon-font-color/><sap-icon-background-color/><sap-icon-font-character></sap-icon-font-character><sap-icon-font-description></sap-icon-font-description></sap-icon-font>).
This option can be useful in the following cases, for example:
You've canceled the dispatch of an order operation.
You now want to remove the <uicontrol>Must start on</uicontrol> constraint that was set automatically when the operation was dispatched.
You've set a new start date for an order operation that has a successor operation.
Due to an existing <uicontrol>Must start on</uicontrol> constraint, the app can't adjust the dates of the successor operation.
Once you remove the constraint for the successor operation, the operation can be rescheduled automatically.
The successor's dates are adjusted automatically if both operations are included in the same maintenance order.
If you've created a cross-order relationship, you must trigger order scheduling manually to have the operation dates adjusted.
View Legal Composition
Navigate to the screen where you can see the legal compositions.
Use
Navigate within this app to the screen where you can see the legal compositions and the related information.
The first step of the navigation is to choose the composition type and the status of the composition that you want to see.
You can identify the screen of the legal composition by the title <uicontrol>Legal Composition</uicontrol>.
To be sure which legal composition you're working on, check the header data area, where <name of composition type> - <name of product> is displayed.
Save as New Version
Use this function to create a new version of the context.
You use this function to create a new version of the context.
A new version of a context can only be created if it is assigned to at least one legal transaction and a major change is applied, such as adding a category.
If you choose <q>Save as New Version</q> and the context is not yet assigned to a legal transaction, an error message informs you to use <q>Save</q> instead.
If you save a new version, a dialog asks you to set a status for the new version.
You can set the status to either Ready or Active.
If you set the status to Active, the system sets the status of the previous version to Replaced and the connection between the two versions is indicated by the Replaced By and Previous Version fields in the general data of the context.
The legal transaction keeps the context version that was originally assigned.
The new version can only be assigned to new legal transactions.
Phases
Start or restart a phase in this facet.
Use
You can start or restart a phase by selecting the available phases.
Phases govern the compliance of a legal transaction.
Once a phase is defined in the <uicontrol>Manage Contexts</uicontrol> app, it will be available in this facet.
You can define the starting conditions for a phase, either as parallel or sequential.
Parallel condition allows multiple phases to start parallely, whereas sequential phases ensures the phases are triggered in a sequence.
You can also see the iteration details of a phase to know the number of times a phase has been repeated.
In addition, you can see which legal document is assigned to a phase and also the current state of a phase - whether content exists in the legal document or if the document is in accepted state.
Base Currency
Currency in which customer balances and sales figures are shown
Definition
Shows the currency in which customer balances and sales figures are displayed.
Use
You can display customer balances and sales figures in the company code currency or in the functional currency.
By default, the company code currency is used.
If you want to see customer balances and sales figures in the functional currency, select <uicontrol>Functional Currency</uicontrol> from the dropdown menu of the <uicontrol>Base Currency</uicontrol> field.
For more information about the functional currency, see:
Restrict Unstaffed Posting
Control time posting by resources in the service organization.
Use
You may use one of the following options to control time posting in projects by resources in the service organization:
<uicontrol>Yes</uicontrol>, to allow resources to post time <emphasis>only</emphasis> if they are staffed or assigned to a project.
This is also the default setting.
<uicontrol>No</uicontrol>, to allow resources to post time on projects without being staffed or assigned to a project.
This value is used as the default setting when projects are created for this service organization.
Create Clarification Case
Create clarification case for selected invoicing request
You can create a clarification case for the contract account of the selected invoicing request or for the invoicing request itself (source document).
You must enter a clarification reason.
To display a clarification case that has been created for an invoicing request, click or tap <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol>, then under <uicontrol>Columns</uicontrol> include <uicontrol>Clarification Case</uicontrol>.
Click or tap <uicontrol>Show Clarification Case</uicontrol> for an invoicing request.
If you don't see <uicontrol>Show Clarification Case</uicontrol>, click or tap <uicontrol>Show Details</uicontrol> to display it.
Working in the Chart
Learn how to work directly in the chart.
Enable the display of non-working times, work center utilization, relationships, and constraints in the chart settings (<sap-icon-font><sap-icon-font-size/><sap-icon-font-color/><sap-icon-background-color/><sap-icon-font-character></sap-icon-font-character><sap-icon-font-description></sap-icon-font-description></sap-icon-font>).
To zoom in (or zoom out) in the timeline at the cursor position, press and hold <keys><key>CTRL</key><key>SHIFT</key></keys>, then scroll up or down.
Drag and Drop Orders and Operations
You can change the start date and time of maintenance orders and order operations by dragging and dropping them one at a time to the desired date in the chart.
If you drag and drop a maintenance order, any included due or dispatched operations are moved as well and any existing constraints on the operation dates are removed.
If you drag and drop an operation bar, the app sets a new date constraint for the start date of the operation.
For more information, see <xref keyref="loioceff91f8e43d444fb242414d725e4fd9"/> in the product assistance.
Change Operations
To change order operations, for example, by changing the performing work center, dispatching the operations, or removing any date constraints, you can either use the toolbar buttons or the context menu for an operation bar in the chart.
Using the toolbar buttons, you can change multiple operations at once.
With this option, you must select the operations by marking the checkbox in the table.
Using the context menu, you can change one operation at a time.
With this option, you don't need to mark the checkbox, just right-click the operation in the chart.
Work with Relationships
You can create and delete relationships between order operations and add offsets between related operations.
To create a relationship between two order operations, proceed as follows:
Select an operation bar and then one of the connection points at the beginning or end of the bar, depending on the type of relationship that you want to create.
Draw a line to the relevant connection point of the operation that you want to relate to the selected one.
If both operations are in the same maintenance order and the related operation does not have a <uicontrol>Must start on</uicontrol> constraint set, the start date of the related operation is adjusted automatically.
To delete a relationship or to add, edit, or delete an offset for a relationship, right-click the relationship in the chart and select the relevant entry from the context menu.
Note that the context menu is only available for explicit relationships.
For more information, see <xref keyref="loio2a1efcc19a194d4392ea377aeab60c08"/> in the product assistance.
Hierarchy View
Display the G/L accounts in YCOA in the expandable FSV structure.
Use
In the <uicontrol>Hierarchy View</uicontrol>, you can drill down the selected FSV structure to a specific G/L account.
You can then navigate from the G/L account to other apps that you have the authorization to access, for example, the <uicontrol>Manage G/L Account Master Data</uicontrol> app for editing account attributes.
If you have the proper authorization, you can also copy an existing G/L account to create a new G/L account.
In this view, you can't sort or filter the columns.
If you need those functions, please use the <uicontrol>List View</uicontrol> instead.
Communication Status
Shows if communication has been made for a matching item.
Shows what communication means and content have been made for the matching item.
The following communication statuses are available:
<uicontrol>Not Started</uicontrol>:
No communication yet.
<uicontrol>Note Added</uicontrol>:
A public note was added.
<uicontrol>Notification Sent</uicontrol>:
A notification was sent to someone for clarifications.
The recipients receive the notification in the header bar of the SAP Fiori launchpad (<sap-icon-font><sap-icon-font-size/><sap-icon-font-color/><sap-icon-background-color/><sap-icon-font-character outputclass="SAP-icons"></sap-icon-font-character><sap-icon-font-description/></sap-icon-font> icon).
Since communication activities are in chronological order, only the latest communication status is shown in the list.
However, you can view the communication history by choosing the status.
Tax Country
Where RITA is enabled, tax country is the tax reporting country.
Definition
Registration for Indirect Taxation Abroad (RITA) enables indirect tax calculation for multiple countries within a single legal entity.
The <uicontrol>tax country</uicontrol> field allows you to maintain a tax country that is different from the company code country.
Rather than calculating and reporting indirect taxation at the company code level, RITA uses the tax country plus the tax code to determine the tax rates and relevant G/L account determination for tax-relevant transactions.
Use
Tax country is always used in combination with a tax code.
If no tax reporting country is entered in the document, the system uses the company code country by default.
Normally, documents contain only one tax reporting country, but there are numerous business cases with multiple tax countries in a single document.
An example would be an incoming supplier invoice with two tax countries, one for goods, the other for services.
Another example can be sales of goods with different tax departure countries, or sales of services to customers in countries where the services are taxed by the receiving country.
In these kinds of cases, the <uicontrol>tax country</uicontrol> is maintained at the line-item level, which simplifies payments and reporting of indirect taxes.
Situation Instances
Section in which you define the situation instance behavior.
Use
In this section, you define basic situation instance behavior:
<uicontrol>Trigger Accumulation</uicontrol>:
<uicontrol>Disabled</uicontrol> is the standard behavior.
It means that each situation instance is displayed on a separate situation page in the <xref keyref="loio5137227e8fce4240830d20a875b99704"/> app.
Change the default setting only for specific use cases.
For more information, refer to the <uicontrol>Situation Instances</uicontrol> section in <xref keyref="loioe456c4a6f4c940999bb57aec4767cc4d"/>.
<uicontrol>Instance Closing Behavior</uicontrol>:
<uicontrol>Close and Keep</uicontrol>:
This is the standard behavior.
When a user manually closes a situation, it is kept in the system and can be reopened.
<uicontrol>Close and Delete</uicontrol>:
When a user closes a situation manually, it is deleted from the system and cannot be reopened.
Responsible Employee (Deprecated)
This filter is being deprecated.
Use
This filter is being deprecated, which means it will be removed from the <uicontrol>Manage Service Contracts</uicontrol> app with SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2208 or later.
When it's removed, it also disappears from the customized filter settings.
You can add the new <uicontrol>Employee Responsible</uicontrol> filter to your filter settings in advance.
In the value help of the new filter, all search results are restricted to the employees responsible for service contracts, excluding those with the business partner role <uicontrol>Employment</uicontrol>.
Period Range
Filters displayed data to a specific time period only.
The time period defined in the <uicontrol>Period Range</uicontrol> field filters the data displayed subsequently for analysis in the <uicontrol>Characteristic Value Combinations</uicontrol> list.
The list displays those characteristic value combinations which have at least one period intersecting the period range.
Note that you can use the <uicontrol>Period Range</uicontrol> selection on the <uicontrol>Characteristic Value Combination</uicontrol> screen to define a differing time period for displaying product allocation period data than selected on the <uicontrol>Monitor Product Allocation Characteristic Value Combinations</uicontrol> screen.
Data is displayed for those period entries whose start or end dates intersect with the defined period range.
If no period range is defined, the start date of the <uicontrol>Period Range</uicontrol> selection defaults to the current date.
Change Work Center
Move the selected operations to another work center.
Level work center utilization by moving one or more order operations to another work center.
Here's how:
Select order operations by marking the checkbox.
You can change the work center for order operations that have the processing status <uicontrol>Due</uicontrol>.
If you want to change the work center for an order operation that you've already scheduled, you must reset it first.
This changes the operation's processing status back to <uicontrol>Due</uicontrol>.
Click this button and select a work center.
The drop-down menu includes all work centers that are assigned to you.
Once you select a new work center, the utilization forecast is updated automatically.
If the new work center has order operations that have already been dispatched or are in process and that overlap with the schedule period, these are added automatically to your schedule.
After the change, the order operation status changes to <uicontrol>Due (Draft)</uicontrol>.
This means that the work center change is only visible in your schedule and is not yet saved in the maintenance order.
To save the new work center in the order operation, you must schedule and dispatch the operation first.
Summarized Explosion
View individual components of a bill of material.
Use
On choosing the <uicontrol>Summarized Explosion</uicontrol> tab, the table provides the following details:
You can view a complete list of all the individual components across all levels in a BOM structure.
The list doesn't show you the structure of the BOM.
Individual components that occur more than once in the structure are aggregated.
You can view the product details by selecting any component or assembly under the <uicontrol>Components</uicontrol> tab.
You're navigated to the <uicontrol>Manage Product Master Data</uicontrol> app.
Contact Person
Enables you to maintain or view data for a contact person at the supplier.
You can enter or view data for a contact person at the supplier, namely an identifier or the name of the <uicontrol>Salesperson</uicontrol>, the salesperson´s <uicontrol>Telephone</uicontrol> number, and reference data for the contact person.
In the field <uicontrol>Salesperson</uicontrol>, you can enter a free text with up to 30 characters.
As a <cite>reference</cite>, you can enter an acronym with up to 12 characters that identifies the person responsible for the purchase order in your supplier´s company (<uicontrol>Your Reference</uicontrol>) and in your own company (<uicontrol>Our Reference</uicontrol>).
You can use the maintained data for the contact person as a filter for the list of purchase orders displayed in the object list of the app <uicontrol>Manage Purchase Orders</uicontrol>.
The data of the contact person is saved with the purchase order, not with the master data of the supplier.
Time Recording
Indicates if time recording is blocked.
Definition
Indicates if time recording is blocked for the selected project or WBS element.
Use
Time recording is carried out using the <cite>Manage My Timesheet</cite> app.
By blocking this function, you stop both posting and reversal.
Variant Name
Contains name of the variants used for run and additional, run-related information.
The <uicontrol>Variant Name</uicontrol> column contains the name of the variant used for the run as defined in the <xref keyref="loio8f377357f1b1ac6be10000000a4450e5"/> app.
Backorder processing runs are normally defined to run in the background, meaning:
Business documents are updated to reflect the recalculated confirmations.
Locked documents are displayed but are excluded from the update.
If <uicontrol>Summary</uicontrol> is displayed below the variant name:
An exception was generated during the initial run.
To rectify the exception by providing a confirmation, at least one additional run was executed on the basis of a preconfigured fallback variant (fallback run).
The results of all the runs required to generate a confirmation have been merged in the summary.
If <uicontrol>Simulation</uicontrol> is displayed below the variant name:
The run has been executed in simulation mode to identify if the run would improve the confirmation data generated during a live run.
Locked documents are not excluded from the simulation.
To re-run backorder processing, click <uicontrol>Simulate Variant</uicontrol> in the variant popover.
Copy Item
Copy existing item to add new one
Definition
Enables you to add items to the sourcing project by copying the existing items.
Use
You can copy existing items or item sets to add new ones to the sourcing project.
If you copy an item set, all subordinate items are copied as well.
Items that are created via the copy function have the same names as the copied items, with the added prefix <uicontrol>Copy of</uicontrol>.
You can edit these newly created items and item sets the same way that you would edit other newly created items.
Slow-Moving Indicator by Plants
Displays two key figures for one material in all available plants.
Definition
Displays the key figures <uicontrol>Slow-Moving Indicator</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Stock Quantity</uicontrol> for one material in all available plants - except the selected plant - based on the parameters <emphasis>key date</emphasis> and <emphasis>days with low consumption</emphasis>.
The chart has been enhanced with two further key figures used for orientation:
<uicontrol>Slow-Moving Indicator</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Stock Quantity</uicontrol>.
Both are based on the filter criteria you have set in the header.
Use
The chart supports you to find plants that have a low <uicontrol>Slow-Moving Indicator</uicontrol> and a high <uicontrol>Stock Quantity</uicontrol> at the same time.
In this case, surplus stock could be transferred to a plant with a high Slow-Moving Indicator but a lower level of stock quantity.
You can directly navigate from a selected plant to the <uicontrol>Transfer Stock - Cross Plant</uicontrol> app to initiate such a stock transfer.
Note that such a stock transfer has two opposite effects:
For the issuing plant the Slow-Moving Indicator will increase due to the fact that the stock quantity decreases.
For the receiving plant the Slow-Moving Indicator will decrease due to the fact that the stock quantity increases.
Value Group Overview Settings
Adjust overview settings
Via the <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol> icon, you have the following options for the <uicontrol>Value Group Overview</uicontrol>:
Add or remove columns to the overview
Sort the group values according to a selected column
Filter the existing group values based on including or excluding filter criteria
Group the group values by group value, group value description or parent value
Using the grouping by group value you get an overview of all group values with their parent values.
Consolidated Balance Sheet
Shows assets and liabilities & equity at the end of the fiscal period.
The consolidated balance sheet is a financial statement that shows assets and liabilities & equity at the end of the fiscal period.
The <uicontrol>Consolidated Balance Sheet</uicontrol> main tab contains the following three detail tabs where you can review the data:
<uicontrol>Overview</uicontrol>: a basic overview of assets and liability & equity
<uicontrol>Assets</uicontrol>: a detailed look at current and noncurrent assets
<uicontrol>Liability & Equity</uicontrol>: a detailed look at equity as well as current and noncurrent liabilities
In the context of IFRS, the consolidated balance sheet is also referred to as the "statement of financial position".

Reset the table personalization.
Debit / Credit Material
Adjust the inventory value
Enables you to adjust the inventory value of the material.
Enter the posting date and a header text for the material document.
For all currency types, specify the revaluation amount and the reference quantity for which the costs are to be posted.
Depending on the price control, the revaluation amounts are posted to a price difference account and/or to the material stock account:
For standard price materials (price control <emphasis>S</emphasis>), the revaluation amount is posted to a price difference account.
The standard price of the material is not changed.
For moving average price materials (price control <emphasis>V</emphasis>), the revaluation amount is posted to the material stock account unless stock coverage is insufficient.
If stock coverage is insufficient, only the portion for the available stock is posted to the stock account; the remainder is posted to a price difference account.
Example for Moving Average Price
A material with price control <emphasis>V</emphasis> has a base quantity of 100 units and an inventory quantity of 50 units.
The inventory value is EUR 500.
If you enter an adjustment of EUR 100, EUR 50 is posted to the material stock account and EUR 50 is posted to the price difference account.
Exposure Items
Represent the exposure of an analysis item.
Definition
Exposure items represent the exposure of an analysis item and are saved on the database.
You create exposure items using the <uicontrol>Take Snapshot</uicontrol> app.
The exposure items are created in relation to the exposure aggregation level of the hedging area:
<uicontrol>Only Net</uicontrol>
The amounts of the incoming and outgoing exposures of the analysis item are aggregated to the net exposure.
This net exposure amount is saved as the net exposure item.
<uicontrol>Only Gross</uicontrol>
The incoming and the outgoing exposures are saved as incoming (gross) exposure item and outgoing (gross) exposure item respectively.
<uicontrol>Net and Gross</uicontrol>
Incoming gross exposure item, outgoing gross exposure item, and net exposure item are created.
Performing Work Center
Narrow down the list of operations based on their work center.
Narrow down the list of maintenance order operations based on their work center.
The input help shows all work centers that are currently assigned to you.
Using this filter has the following effect:
The <uicontrol>Maintenance Order Operations</uicontrol> tab shows operations and suboperations for the relevant work centers.
The <uicontrol>Maintenance Orders</uicontrol> tab shows the orders that include the filtered operations, even if the main work center is a different one.

Personalize how to display the labels of the boxes representing kanban containers, and optionally show the container status text.
Choose how to display container labels by selecting one of the options:
<uicontrol>Container ID</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Control Cycle Item</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Control Cycle Item (or Container ID for Event-Driven)</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Quantity</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>No Text</uicontrol>.
In addition, decide whether the status text shows as subtitle in the container:
<uicontrol>Only when using high contrast themes</uicontrol> The status text shows if you have selected to use an SAP high contrast theme.
<uicontrol>Always</uicontrol> The status text always shows.
<uicontrol>Never</uicontrol> The status text never shows.
Together with all layout settings, you can save board settings by using the <uicontrol>My Views</uicontrol> dropdown of the variant management at the top left corner of the <uicontrol>Kanban Board</uicontrol>.
Deposit at Notice
Use
A deposit at notice is an investment or borrowing without defined due dates.
The deposit at notice therefore not only includes the functions available in the fixed-term deposit area, but also a function for giving notice.
In other words, in addition to entering the amounts and conditions, you enter the notice period and the interest payment date and frequency.
The <sap-technical-name>52B</sap-technical-name><uicontrol>Deposit at Notice(variable)</uicontrol> product type is based on product category <sap-technical-name>550</sap-technical-name><uicontrol>Interest Rate Instrument</uicontrol>, which has the term category <uicontrol>At Notice</uicontrol> and allows you to enter interest conditions of the types <uicontrol>Fixed</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Variable</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Scaled (Incremental)</uicontrol>, and <uicontrol>Scaled (Interval)</uicontrol>.

Overwrite Manually Adjusted Actual Flows
Indicator for overwriting some attributes of an actual cash flow.
Use
Flow Builder Plus derives account assignments for a cash flow.
You can adjust it manually in the app <uicontrol>Check Cash Flow Items</uicontrol>.
If you do not select this function, Flow Builder Plus will not overwrite the adjusted values or flows resulting from the manual adjustment.
If you select this function, Flow Builder Plus will overwrite the adjusted values or flows resulting from the manual adjustment.
Budget-Relevant
Influences for expenditure postings the availability control and the consumable budget.
Definition
The budget-relevant indicator is an important setting and updated as part of a journal entry in the Universal Journal (<sap-technical-name>ACDOCA</sap-technical-name>).
The behavior of this budgetary setting is however differently interpreted for accounts classified as <emphasis>'Expense'</emphasis>’ or <emphasis>'Revenue'</emphasis> types.
Use
In the case of commitment and actual <emphasis>'Expenses'</emphasis>, the budget-relevant indicator determines whether availability control (AVC) is performed and budget is consumed.
In AVC reporting, this is then reported as part of the <uicontrol>Amount Consumed</uicontrol>.
General ledger accounts classified as <emphasis>'Revenues'</emphasis> in the budgetary settings of a general ledger account do not participate in AVC nor are they reported as part of the <uicontrol>Amount Consumed</uicontrol>.
The default setting for those revenue type accounts is <emphasis>'Not Budget-Relevant'</emphasis> (indicator is not set).
The budget-relevant indicator can however also be set for revenue accounts, which allows for distinction in reporting.
Technical Objects
Displays the available technical objects and their details.
Definition
Technical objects have two types:
<emphasis>Equipment</emphasis>: physical object which is an autonomous unit.
<emphasis>Functional location</emphasis>: component in a technical system on which you can perform a maintenance task.
Use
You can find information about, for example, maintenance plants, manufacturers, and planner groups which are related to the technical objects.
If you click the technical object name, the application provides navigation targets to further technical object actions.
To find information about the related maintenance notifications, orders, and items, you need to click the row of the technical object.
Price Simulation
Enables you to simulate a price for a central purchase contract item.
Use
You can simulate the price for a particular central purchase contract item for a given date.
To do this, navigate to the <uicontrol> Price Simulation</uicontrol> section under the <uicontrol>Conditions</uicontrol> facet.
Provide all the mandatory details such as the Pricing Date, Currency, and Quantity, and choose<uicontrol> Simulate</uicontrol>.
This determines the price of the particular item for the specified date period.
You can perform all the above mentioned features for a central purchase contract hierarchy as well.
Add to Scheduling Worklist
Adds a selected settlement date to a scheduling worklist.
Definition
Adds a selected settlement date with the settlement status <uicontrol>Open</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Due</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Due Today</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Overdue</uicontrol> to a scheduling worklist to schedule the settlement of the selected settlement date.
Use
Choose <uicontrol>Add to Scheduling Worklist</uicontrol> to add a settlement date to a scheduling worklist.
You can then decide to choose an existing scheduling worklist or create a new one.
