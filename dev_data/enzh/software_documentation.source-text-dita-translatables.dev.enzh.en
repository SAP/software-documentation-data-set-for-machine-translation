Report Category
Categorize reports based on business features and country/region
Definition
Used to categorize statutory reports based on specific business features and the country/region of reporting
Use
To adhere to your statutory reporting requirements, you may need to submit tax reports to the government for a new functionality.
You may also need to group versions of report based on functionality, country/region, organizational units, phases, or reporting activities.
You can create such functional groups through <uicontrol>Report Categories</uicontrol>.
You can now create independent report categories using the <uicontrol>Define Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app.
You must assign country/region, phases, organizational units, and activities to a report category.
While assigning activities, you assign the phase to which it belongs.
You can monitor and run the reporting activities in the<uicontrol> Run Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app.
Creating a report category involves the following steps:
Assign country/region
You assign a country/region to the report category.
Add phases
You create phases for your report category.
A phase is used to identify the type of report run that is generated in the app.
A phase can be of type - <uicontrol>declaration</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>correction</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>additional correction</uicontrol>.
When you generate a report run, by default, the report run type is <uicontrol>declaration</uicontrol>.
Standard phase is the first submission to the government.
Based on the country/region-specific requirements, you can generate a correction report, or additional correction report for the documents from the previous submissions or for the documents that may have been omitted from the previous submissions or runs.
You set the valid from date, and assign the phase occurrence as <uicontrol>Single</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Multiple</uicontrol> for all the phases.
When you set the phase occurrence as <uicontrol>Single</uicontrol>, all the activities of the phase can be submitted only once.
After your activities are complete, you will not be able to process the activities again in the phase.
When you choose the phase occurrence as <uicontrol>Multiple</uicontrol>, all the activities of the phase can be submitted any number of times after the report has been accepted, until the due date.
You can repeat the phase multiple times.
You can set the submission possible until for correction and additional correction runs.
It is set in years, months, or days.
For example, if Submission Possible Until is set as 2 Months – It implies that you can start the correction runs after the standard submission and until 2 months after the current reporting period end date.
You can also set negative values for months and days.
Assign Organizational Units
You assign organizational units to a report category.
You can submit tax reports at different reporting levels via the use of organizational units.
The reporting levels currently supported for both <uicontrol>classic</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>enhanced</uicontrol> modes are - <uicontrol>company code</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>business place</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>jurisdiction code</uicontrol>, and <uicontrol>section code</uicontrol>.
This feature allows you to use the <uicontrol>Run Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app to submit reports for countries/regions that require reporting at these additional levels.
For example, Canada tax authorities require tax reporting at company code and tax jurisdiction levels.
You can set values for the reporting levels while configuring the reporting entity.
The assigned values get defaulted when you run the reports.
You can assign the organizational units to the report categories in the <uicontrol>Define Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app.
Assign Reporting Activities
Reporting activities are steps that needs to be performed to complete end-to-end compliance reporting process.
In the <uicontrol>Define Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app, you create new reporting activities.
You assign activities to your report category, based on your legal reporting requirements.
While assigning activities, you assign the phase to which it belongs.
You can monitor and run the reporting activities in the <uicontrol>Run Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app.
To understand the complete flow in <uicontrol>Run Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app and<uicontrol> Define Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app, please see the below sample scenario:
To start with, in the <uicontrol>Define Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app, you should perform the following steps:
Create a report category REPCAT.
Assign a country/region to the report category.
Create a declaration and a correction phase for the report category.
Assign company code as the organizational unit to report category.
Assign an activity A1 of type - SAP Fiori Application for the declaration phase.
Add another activity A2 of type - Report Definition for the correction phase.
In the <uicontrol>Run Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app, when you select the report category and choose <uicontrol>Go</uicontrol>, you can see all the reporting tasks for the category.
Select the reporting task that you want to execute.
When you start the new phase, you can see the activity A1 in the declaration phase.
After the declaration phase is complete, the system allows you to start the new phase.
Choose Start new phase to start the correction phase.
The system executes the activity A2 assigned to the correction phase.
All Slots
Filter for different time slot views in the sequence table.
You can select any of the following options:
<uicontrol>All Slots</uicontrol>- Displays all available time slots for a work center that also includes slots with dispatched orders.
<uicontrol>Slots with Sufficient Capacity</uicontrol>- Displays time slots that have enough capacity to accommodate the order operation.
<uicontrol>Slots with Overlapping Capacity</uicontrol>- Displays the conflicting time slots of multiple order operations that have been dispatched.
You can deallocate and dispatch one of the orders on a different slot.
Top-Level Materials
Shows the capacity consumption of the top-level materials of the work center.
You can see how each top-level material contributes to the capacity consumption of the work center.
If there is a capacity issue, you have the possibility to shift the capacity demand to an earlier point in time.
Check, if this mitigates the capacity issue and click <uicontrol>Shift Top-Level Demand</uicontrol>.
Then check if the proposal is acceptable.
From the top-level material you can navigate to the <uicontrol>Multi-Level Material Simulation</uicontrol>, a structured view of the bill of material, and make simulations on material component level.
For example, you can change the source of supply or you have the possibility to preproduce a component.
Report Run Type
Shows the type of the report run
Definition
Shows the type of the report run that you have generated for this report.
A report run can be of type - declaration, correction, or additional correction.
Use
When you generate a report run, by default, the report run type is <emphasis>declaration</emphasis>.
When you submit the report to the government, the government accepts the submitted report if its content is correct, or declines it, if it must be corrected.
The tax authorities in some countries allow you to submit correction run, or additional correction run after the standard tax submission process.
This ensures that you have an option to make the required modifications to the earlier tax submission documents.
The additional correction run may require documents in formats and data, different than the standard or correction runs.
You can configure additional correction phase for a report category in the <uicontrol>Define Advanced Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app.
In the <uicontrol>Run Advanced Compliance Reports</uicontrol> app, after the standard submission, you can start a new phase, and choose correction or additional correction as per your requirements.
For example, consider that as per the compliance guidelines of a country, you can generate a correction run after the standard submission, until 25 days after the reporting period end date.
For any correction after 25 days, you can submit an additional correction, until one year after the reporting period end date.
So, if you find an error within 25 days, after the reporting period end date, you can correct the error and generate via a correction run.
However, if you find an error 25 days after the reporting period end date, you can still make the corrections and submit them via the additional correction runs, that is valid until one year from the reporting period end date.
Bonds
Bonds are interest bearing securities that guarantee the payment of interests and the repayment at the end of term.
You can create the class data for bonds using product type <xref id="lockTU_88b8e2e6-bd8a-4305-8dc7-70e92c93790c"/><uicontrol>Bonds</uicontrol>.
You can create different kinds of bond by defining class data and the conditions accordingly:
Fixed-interest bonds
Floating-rate notes
Zero-coupon bonds
You can manage the following processes for bonds:
These processes cover master data management, the trading and processing of securities transactions (including the placement and redemption of issued bonds), as well as paying and posting in Financial Accounting.
In addition, various functions for managing security positions and for period-end closing are available.
Treasury Reporting provides you with a broad range of apps for analyzing your debts and investments in bonds.
In Stock
Specifies whether the required quantity of the material is in stock.
Use
The availability of the spare parts that you require is of utmost importance for planning your repair work.
You decide which spare parts you require for the repair work.
You can use plus and minus buttons to increase or decrease the quantity of the required material.
The system displays whether the quantity of the material you require is available in the appropriate plant/storage location.
Apart from purchase orders and reservations, this availability check also takes into account requirements from sales documents as well as requirements resulting from delivery notes.
If you search in the bill of material, the system performs the availability check for the plant that has been defined for this bill of material.
If you enter a preferred storage location in the <cite>Personalization </cite> app on the tab page <cite>EAMS Web UI</cite>, these values are used as default filter values for the storage location and plant in the <cite>Report and Repair Malfunction </cite> app.
This means that the system would then also perform the availability check using the bill of material based on your preferred storage location.
Consolidation Version
A version of data comprised of special versions used to fulfill different reporting needs.
Enter the consolidation version you'd like to use to generate your financial statements.
A consolidation version identifies a separate data area in the consolidation database.
Versions make it possible to consolidate different sets of financial data or consolidate in different group currencies.
Because of this, they can be created and used to fulfill different reporting needs.
For example, one version with actuals data can be used for publishing official reports, and another with planning and forecast data can be used for internal evaluation.
Each consolidation version is comprised of an array of special versions in which customizing settings from the various areas of Consolidation are saved.
For example, special versions for data entry, tax rates, translation methods, and so on.
Special versions reduce the amount of effort required for defining and maintaining consolidation versions, which are largely identical.
This is because each special version is maintained centrally and can be referenced by any number of consolidation versions.
In this way, if you change the settings of a special version, then these changes are automatically reflected in all the consolidation versions that contain this special version.
To learn more about consolidation versions, see <xref keyref="loioaed5eca9c8294b398ab968c54abd4fed"/>.
Go Back to Scoping
Add or remove operations or check the utilization forecast.
Go from <uicontrol>Refinement</uicontrol> back to <uicontrol>Scoping</uicontrol> if you want to do the following:
Adjust the scope of your schedule by adding or removing order operations
Check the forecasted work center utilization for the schedule period
Move (due) order operations to another work center
Trigger (re-)scheduling for all relevant operations in your schedule

Use in Compatible Group
Allows reusing the maintained hierarchies in group-related applications.
For some hierarchy types, such as cost center, segment, functional area, company code, and G/L account, the hierarchies maintained in <uicontrol>Manage Global Hierarchies</uicontrol> can be reused in group maintenance or usage applications, such as <uicontrol>Manage Cost Center Groups</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Manage Allocations</uicontrol>.
To achieve this, when editing these hierarchies, you select the <uicontrol>Use in Compatible <hierarchy type> Group</uicontrol> checkbox.
Upon activation in this app, each hierarchy and all its contained nodes are made available in the target apps as follows:
<emphasis>Group</emphasis> is generated with the structure same as the parent node defined in <uicontrol>Manage Global Hierarchies</uicontrol>, while the special character "<xref id="lockTU_68c9d05a-fd0f-4731-a278-f14d08d8ccb8"/>" is appended to the hierarchy ID as the group ID.
<emphasis>Subgroups</emphasis> are generated with the structures same as the subnodes defined in <uicontrol>Manage Global Hierarchies</uicontrol>.
Each subgroup ID is comprised of hierarchy ID, the special character "<xref id="lockTU_9c7e006d-36d3-4318-b651-ae251b2d5bbd"/>", and subnode ID.
The following cost center hierarchy CC100 with nodes <xref id="lockTU_e12deb03-6f83-4761-85b9-f744386968f5"/>, <xref id="lockTU_a5037bdf-b830-4c9a-8a44-02068e8cdb8a"/>, and <xref id="lockTU_75c13d67-f0ed-4c80-97a0-d5f50a65793b"/> generates four group IDs in <uicontrol>Manage Cost Center Groups</uicontrol>:

Generated Group ID
CC100
CC100~
--| PROD
CC100~PROD
--| SALES
CC100~SALES
--| MKTG
CC100~MKTG
Make sure that every group ID (consisting of hierarchy ID, node ID and the special character '~') doesn't exceed the limit of 15 characters.
Certificate Status
Status of the certificate receipt
Definition
Specifies the status of a certificate receipt, for example, whether a certificate is expected from the supplier or whether it was received already.
Use
When the certificate record is created, it has the status <uicontrol>Expected</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Received</uicontrol>, depending on whether the record already has the actual certificate attached.
You can set statuses using the corresponding buttons, for example, set the status <uicontrol>Received</uicontrol> when you have uploaded a certificate that was sent separately, for example, by email.
If the certificate status is <uicontrol>Received</uicontrol> and inspection lot processing is active, the inspection lot status is also changed automatically.
If receipt of the certificate was already confirmed and the status was changed retrospectively to <uicontrol>Expected</uicontrol>, then the inspection lot status does not change.
New features in Manage Workflows for Supplier Invoices
With this app, you can now do the following:
You can define as start condition that an invoice is blocked due to price variance and/or due to quantity variance.
Depending on the workflow result, you can assign an email template and define the recipients.
The email template offers more details such as the invoice number, company code, supplier, or gross amount.
If you have configured a decision reason with decision reason ID <cite>OTHERS</cite> in your <uicontrol>Configuration Environment</uicontrol>, it is mandatory, that the approver enters a comment during the rejection of the work item in the app <uicontrol>My Inbox</uicontrol>.
For the scenario <cite>Workflow for Parked Invoice as Complete</cite>, you can also define that the supplier invoice is automatically posted.
Hierarchy
Hierarchical structure of G/L accounts
Definition
A financial statement version is a hierarchical structure of general ledger accounts based on legal regulations and your specific requirements.
It consists of financial statement version items such as <uicontrol>Assets</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Liabilities</uicontrol>.
Use
You use financial statement versions to display the financial statement with a hierarchical view.
In the <uicontrol>Prompts</uicontrol> window enter a <uicontrol>Hierarchy ID</uicontrol> that specifies a financial statement version.
Add to Sourcing Project
Enables you to add purchase requisition items to an existing sourcing project.
Use
Select one or multiple purchase requisition items and from the <uicontrol>Add to Document</uicontrol> drop-down list choose <uicontrol>Add to Sourcing Project</uicontrol>.
This opens the <uicontrol>Select Sourcing Project Type</uicontrol> screen, where you can use the following search options to filter the results:
Sourcing Project, Sourcing Project Name, Sourcing Project Type, Central Company Code, Central Purchasing Group, Central Purchasing Organization, Material Group, Currency, Purchasing Responsible, Status.
Select the sourcing project in <uicontrol>Sourcing Project Type</uicontrol> screen based on your requirements and click <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol>.
The <uicontrol>Add to Sourcing Project </uicontrol> option is enabled only in case of a material item, and purchase requisition is in approved status and not in closed status.
If a purchase requisition item is part of one sourcing project, you cannot add the same item to another sourcing project.
Include Supplementary Account Assignment
When you select this option, journal entries are not cleared if the clearing entry contains automatically generated line items that normally could be changed using manual clearing.
Allows you to prevent journal entries from being cleared if the clearing entry contains automatically generated line items that normally could be changed using manual clearing.
This means the following:
If you select this option and if the <uicontrol>Supplement auto. postings</uicontrol> option is set in the master record of the G/L account to which the automatic posting is to be made, clearing is <emphasis>not</emphasis> carried out.
If this option is not set and the <uicontrol>Supplement auto. postings</uicontrol> option is set in the master record of the G/L account, clearing is carried out (however, without the option of changing the automatically generated items).
In general, you should consider whether it is useful to select the <uicontrol>Supplement auto. posting</uicontrol> option in the master record of the G/L account at all.
Contract Liabilities
The amount of contract liabilities up to the current accounting period
Use
A <emphasis>contract liability</emphasis> is your company’s obligation to transfer goods or services to a customer for which your company has received consideration from the customer (or the payment is due) but the transfer has not yet been completed.
A <emphasis>contract asset</emphasis> is your company’s right to consideration in exchange for goods or services that your company has transferred to a customer when that right is conditioned on something other than the passage of time (for example, your company’s future performance).
<emphasis>Receivables</emphasis> should be recorded separately from contract assets since only the passage of time is required before consideration is due.
When goods or services have been transferred to a customer, but customer payment is contingent based on a future event, this amount is generally referred to as an <emphasis>unbilled receivable</emphasis>.
The amounts displayed are calculated at the revenue contract level and are the sum of the amounts of all performance obligations.
At the performance obligation level they are calculated as follows:
<systemoutput>Contract Liability = Max {(Payment Due – Recognized Revenue), 0}</systemoutput>
<systemoutput>Contract Asset = Max {(Recognized Revenue - Receivable), 0}</systemoutput>
<systemoutput>Receivable = Posted Revenue + Contract Liability – Contract Asset</systemoutput>
<systemoutput>Billed Receivable = If {Contractual Price >=0, Max {Min (Invoiced Amount, Receivable), 0}, Min {Max (Invoiced Amount, Receivable), 0}}</systemoutput>
<systemoutput>Unbilled Receivable = Receivable – Unbilled Receivable</systemoutput>
Factoring Discount Tax
Specifies the tax amount that results from the factoring discount.
Definition
The <uicontrol>Factoring Discount Tax</uicontrol> field specifies the tax amount that results from the payer's factoring discount (also known as a del credere discount).
Use
Depending on the tax structure of the country, payers may be liable to pay taxes for the factoring discounts that they receive.
During invoice list processing, you can reimburse the payer for this tax liability in advance by creating special condition records.
Simulation Run
To show simulation results and run validations in simulation mode.
Setting for this checkbox applies to both result display and validation run, that is, if you select this checkbox, the following occurs:
The table displays only the simulation run results.
The <uicontrol>New Validation</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Revalidate</uicontrol> operations only run in simulation mode.
Simulation run doesn't update task status or consider any blocking status in monitors.
It is equivalent to the <uicontrol>Test with Original List</uicontrol> feature in the monitors.
Field Groups
Allocate quantities and in transaction currency.
Use
When you create an allocation cycle using the allocation types <uicontrol>Distribution</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Overhead Allocation</uicontrol>, on the allocation cycle detail screen, under the <uicontrol>Field Group</uicontrol> tab, you have the option to select checkboxes for <uicontrol>Actual/Plan Quantities</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Actual/Plan Transaction Currency</uicontrol>.
The options displayed depend on whether you are allocating actual or plan data.
<uicontrol>Actual/Plan Quantities</uicontrol>
Select this checkbox to allocate quantities along with amounts.
For example, if you are allocating costs from a consulting cost center that includes consulting hours, select this checkbox to allocate the number of hours as well as the costs to the receiver during the allocation run.
<uicontrol>Actual/Plan Transaction Currency</uicontrol>
Select this checkbox to allocate costs in the original posted transaction currency during an allocation run.
For example, you are a company with EUR as the company code currency and USD as the global currency, but you don’t want costs converted to either of those currencies during the allocation run.
In that case, you select this checkbox to keep allocated amounts in the same currency as the transaction posted in the sender, for example JPY.
Selecting this checkbox enables the <uicontrol>Transaction Currency</uicontrol> field in the allocation run result.
My Projects
Filters results based on responsibility or authorization.
Use
You may use this filter to switch the results between projects that you are responsible for (due to your assignment to a project role) and projects that you are authorized to access.
You may choose one of the following values:
<userinput>Yes</userinput>, to filter, search, and display resource requests from projects that you are responsible for.
This list includes resource requests only from public and private projects where you've been assigned to a project role.
<userinput>No</userinput>, to filter, search, and display resource requests from projects that you are authorized to access even if you haven't been assigned to a project role.
This list may consist of resuts from both public and private projects depending on the authorizations granted to your business role.
Process Flow
An overview of the process happened.
Definition
The process flow provides an overview of the connected business documents from the sales contract to journal entries.
Use
You can view the details, such as status and value, of the following connected business objects (if applicable):
The sales contract
Sales orders, such as standard sales orders, credit memo requests, debit memo requests, and returns orders
Delivery documents, such as outbound deliveries and returns deliveries
Billing documents, such as invoices, credit memos, and down payment requests
Journal entries
You can gain more insights directly from the process flow by:
Branching directly to the object pages of the relevant business objects.
Navigating to all related apps for which the user is authorized, for example, the <uicontrol>Display Journal Entries</uicontrol> app.
Posting Type
Types of postings (line items) to include.
You can choose which kinds of postings (line items) you would like to display:
<uicontrol>All</uicontrol> – All postings.
<uicontrol>Actual</uicontrol> – Only unrecognized postings that reflect actual costs inferred through business operations such as invoicing, taxing, and other.
<uicontrol>Recognized</uicontrol> – Only postings that are determined as recognized using the event-based revenue recognition model.
To learn more about event-based revenue recognition, see <xref keyref="loio7fd9ad1108b94403a2871cf348d4b891"/>.
Rescheduling Check
Starts the rescheduling check.
Definition
Executes an automatic check to find out whether receipts are required to cover requirement quantities or whether they can be canceled, be brought forward, or postponed if their current dates are not suitable.
Use
You can start the rescheduling check in the table view.
If you choose <uicontrol>Rescheduling Check</uicontrol>, the system carries out the rescheduling check for the following MRP elements:
Purchase requisition
Purchase order
Planned order
Production order
Process order
Scheduling agreement
In the <uicontrol>Rescheduling</uicontrol> column, you can see the actions proposed for each MRP element.
Spend Category
Allows filtering by the costs of a certain cost element group
Definition
An organizational entity that combines cost elements of the same type.
The spend categories correspond to the cost element groups that your administrator has created in the <cite>Finance</cite> (<xref id="lockTU_4f703c84-cfe8-43e4-a7e4-ea63983ec28b"/>) master data.
Use
If you select a filter value for the spend category, the system only displays costs of this cost element group in the content area.
If the cost element group is part of a cost element hierarchy, the system displays the costs of the relevant cost element group and costs of the direct lower-level cost element group.
Edit Default Waste Generator
Edit the waste generator field if necessary.
Step 2 starts by assessing the waste generator field.
You can either keep the default waste generator or choose the value help in the mandatory <uicontrol>Waste Generator</uicontrol> field and a dialog box will appear.
A default location, aka waste generator, defined the <uicontrol>Set My Location</uicontrol> app, will be available for use.
Use the dropdown list in the upper left corner of the dialog box to select the search template you want to use.
You will have two possibilities to search for different waste generators:
<uicontrol>My Waste Generators</uicontrol> displays waste generators where you are assigned as an <uicontrol>Environmental Manager</uicontrol>
<uicontrol>All Waste Generators</uicontrol> displays all waste generators
You can only choose a waste generator which is already assigned to at least one waste stream and a corresponding active disposal channel.
For more information, please see <xref keyref="loio2ae009c3f9284aae8906ebad075ea0e2"/>
Add Counter, Restricted/Calculated/Converted Measure
This option allows you to define a restricted, calculated, or converted measure in the corresponding data source.
<emphasis>Restricted Measure</emphasis>:
Use Restricted Measure to define a field that is filtered based on a specific condition.
By applying the restricted measure to a field, you generate a result set for comparative analysis of data.
<emphasis>Calculated Measures</emphasis>:
Use Calculated Measure to convert from one unit of measure to another.
Choose “Edit” to define the conversion logic.
The editor provides you with elements, operators, and predefined analytical functions to define an expression.
<emphasis>Converted Meaures</emphasis>:
Use Converted Measure to convert unit or currency measures from one value to another.
<emphasis>Counter</emphasis>:
Use to retrieve distinct count of the combination of dimensions.
The list of dimensions may vary based on the data source it is derived from.
Procurement Type
You can use this to filter your products based on their procurement type
You can use this to filter your products based on their procurement type.
With Demand-Driven Replenishment, the procurement type for products that are
produced in-house is <emphasis>Make</emphasis>
procured from external sources is <emphasis>Buy</emphasis>
transferred in through STOs is <emphasis>Transfer</emphasis>
If the procurement type for a product is not maintained, it will appear as <emphasis>Missing</emphasis>.
Materials / Supply
Click to change perspectives.
You can switch between two perspectives:
<uicontrol>Materials</uicontrol>
Lists all components and their demand quantities per time period (week or month).
You can extend the table row of a component to view the corresponding production version or supplier (sources of supply).
If no source of supply exists for a component, <uicontrol>No Valid Supplier</uicontrol> is displayed in the table row.
<uicontrol>Supply</uicontrol>
Groups the list of components according to their source of supply:
<uicontrol>Anonymous Supplier</uicontrol>
Is displayed when no source or no supplier exists for externally procured materials.
<uicontrol>In-House Production</uicontrol>
Is displayed when a production version exists without a production line specified.
The name of the supplier is displayed for each component with a clearly identified supplier.
The name of the production line is displayed for each component with a production version and a specified production line.
Release Planned Price Changes
Sets future prices to the standard price
When you release planned price changes, the valid future prices become the current standard price of the materials in the relevant currencies and valuations.
The planned prices must exist in the material master and they must be valid based on the validity date.
If no valid planned prices exist, the materials will continue to be valued with the valuation price used up to this point.
If the price determination indicator in the material master is set to 3 (<uicontrol>Single-/Multilevel</uicontrol>), the following prerequisites must be fulfilled:
The status of the material ledger data for the current period must be <uicontrol>Period opened</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Price change complete</uicontrol>.
This means that there has been no goods movement, invoice, or order settlement posted for the material after period closing.
The closing entries for the previous period’s material price determination have not yet been made.
Thresholds
If you want errors to be issued whenever price changes exceed a certain threshold, select <uicontrol>Consider Thresholds for Price Changes</uicontrol> and adjust the percentages to the desired values.
Calculate Records
Calculates theoretical volume of line items created when cycle runs
Use
You use the <uicontrol>Calculate Records</uicontrol> button to calculate the theoretical data volume that will be created when you run the allocation cycle.
You specify a ledger and indicate the fiscal and reference periods, then the system calculates the theoretical volume of line items based on the sender and reference data.
If the data volume is too high, you will receive a warning message.
This may mean you should re-define the allocation cycle or limit the number of periods to avoid performance problems.
The calculate records function is only available for use with the <uicontrol>Top-Down Distribution</uicontrol> allocation type.
Incident ID
The incident ID references customer support cases or SAP internal incidents.
For the <uicontrol>Customer Support</uicontrol> access category, the incident ID references customer support cases that document the purpose of SAP support user access to customer systems.
These cases can be reviewed by customers in customer service management.
For the <uicontrol>Heath Check Support </uicontrol> access category, the incident ID references SAP internal incidents raised by automatic health checks.
These incidents are not visible to customers.
The incident ID is empty for SAP support user access with the <uicontrol>Operations</uicontrol> access category.
Access of this category is not based on individual support cases or incidents.
New Subnode
Create subnodes for your custom business object.
When you create a custom business object, you automatically create its root node.
You can add subnodes that can be used in applications based on the custom business object, for example.
You can select which operations (<uicontrol>Create</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Update</uicontrol> and/or <uicontrol>Delete</uicontrol>) are allowed for each subnode as well as the root node by ticking the corresponding boxes.
Keep in mind, however, that the restrictions only apply when the CBO is accessed via UI or service.
All operations can still be performed via the Write API.
When you create a subnode, you specify its name in singular, its name in plural, and its ID.
The ID is later needed when you want to add custom logic to your subnode.
Make sure, your subnode has a meaningful and understandable ID.
When you create an application based on the custom business object, you can add subnodes to provide additional information on the detail screen of a list item in the application.
The subnode name is used as tab title on a list item's detail screen in the generated application.
The fields of a subnode are displayed as fields, for example entry fields or checkboxes, collected under the tab title on a list item's detail screen.
Quick Edit
Changes planning data with immediate effect.
Via this mode you can make immediate changes to the planning data of a product allocation object, for example, change quantities or change the constraint status.
There is no <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Cancel</uicontrol> function.
Changes via the <uicontrol>Quick Edit</uicontrol> mode are immediately visible for the product allocation check and do not create a draft version of the data.
If another user is editing the same characteristic value combination in parallel via the regular Edit mode and a draft version of the planning data has been created, the <uicontrol>Quick Edit</uicontrol> mode will not available as long as the lock for the draft exists.
You can leave the <uicontrol>Quick Edit</uicontrol> mode via the <uicontrol>Display</uicontrol> button, the global <uicontrol>Edit</uicontrol> button or by leaving the screen.
Check
Verifies whether G/L account numbers have already been used
Use
Choose this button to verify whether the G/L account numbers that you want to use have already been used in the delivered chart of accounts.
You can see the result of the check under <uicontrol>G/L Accounts</uicontrol> in the <uicontrol>Validation Info</uicontrol> column.
This app carries out checks to ensure that:
The G/L account IDs present in the Delivered ID column are present in the SAP system as well.
The G/L account IDs present in the Mapped ID column are not present in the SAP system.
This is because the merging of two G/L accounts is not allowed.
The mapped G/L account IDs are not alphanumeric characters.
The length of mapped G/L account IDs do not exceed the significant length of a G/L account for the Chart of Accounts.
The description of the G/L account is only possible for the languages in which the descriptions are already defined.
Descriptions cannot be defined in additional languages.
Source Reference Transaction
Shows the type of source document that triggered the error
Use
Depending on your scope, this app can check different types of source documents in your predictive accounting process.
The following types of source documents are supported:
Sales order (<systemoutput>VBAK</systemoutput>)
Service contracts (<systemoutput>SVCT</systemoutput>)
If you use predictive accounting for different types of source documents, use this field to filter the documents by type in the <uicontrol>Standard</uicontrol> view.
Distribution Method
The method by which costs are distributed.
The distribution method is either <uicontrol>Percentage</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Equivalence</uicontrol>.
Percentage rules distribute costs to the receivers according to the percentages listed in the table under <uicontrol>Posting Rule</uicontrol>.
The equivalence method distributes costs to receivers in proportion to the equivalence numbers.
For example, if you want to settle an order to three different cost centers, and you select the equivalence numbers 1, 2, 4, then the costs are distributed as follows:
The first cost center receives 1/7 of the costs
The second cost center receives 2/7 of the costs
The third cost center receives 4/7 of the costs
Whichever method is not used will always show zero values in the table.
In some cases, receivers have a <uicontrol>Special Distribution Method</uicontrol> instead of the standard percentage or equivalence method.
Special methods include Product Cost Collector Delivery Value, and Fixed Price Co-Product Amount Settlement.
Mass Create
Creates multiple responsibilities in one step.
To save time and ensure error-free handling, you can use the <uicontrol>Mass Create</uicontrol> pushbutton to trigger the creation of multiple order fulfillment responsibilities in one step.
When doing so, you must specify the split criterion and the default horizon that will be used for all the order fulfillment responsibilities.
Furthermore, you can define if the order fulfillment responsibilities are to be valid for sales and/or strock transport orders and which <xref keyref="loio427e9b5e285646e88d50c00c972bad03"/> is to be applied.
All values are specified in the <uicontrol>Create Multiple Order Fulfillment Responsibilities</uicontrol> dialog:
<uicontrol>Split Criterion</uicontrol> is the base characteristic for each of your order fulfillment responsibilities, for example, a specific plant or material group.
If you choose plant as your split criterion, the app will create one order fulfillment responsibility for each of the plants at which a material exists in your system.
<uicontrol>Default Horizon</uicontrol> is the processing time frame for the order data your order fulfillment specialists see in the <uicontrol>Release for Delivery</uicontrol> app, expressed in days.
If you define the default horizon to be two days, the <uicontrol>Release for Delivery</uicontrol> app displays order data for materials with a material availability date within the next two days when an order fulfillment specialist opens a worklist for a specific order fulfillment responsibility.
Note that although you can create multiple order fulfillment responsibilities in one step, you cannot assign multiple order fulfillment responsibilities to multiple order fulfillment specialists in one step: assignments can be made to individual order fulfillment specialists only.
Labeling and Marking of Package
Add or remove labels and markings for the packages of your dangerous goods.
Definition
In this section, you can add, remove, and adjust labeling or marking information for the packages of your dangerous goods.
Use
The system calculates and automatically assigns the labels and markings that the packages of your dangerous goods require.
Afterwards, but before you press <uicontrol>Save</uicontrol> to release the packaged dangerous goods classification, you can adjust the labeling or marking information by pressing <uicontrol>Add</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol>.
Third Party Function

Definition
Indicates the function of the third party in the exchange of consent data.
The following values are possible:
<uicontrol>No third party involved (0)</uicontrol>
<uicontrol>Recipient (1)</uicontrol>:
The third party receives consent data from your organization.
<uicontrol>Source (2)</uicontrol>:
The third party obtained the consent data from the data subject and shared it with your organization.
Post on Account
Posts the entire amount of the bank statement item on account
Definition
Posts the <emphasis>entire amount</emphasis> of the bank statement item on account.
Use
You can choose the <uicontrol>Post and Complete</uicontrol> or the <uicontrol>Post and Do Not Complete</uicontrol> button.
If you choose the <uicontrol>Post and Complete</uicontrol> button, the system posts the bank statement item on account and sets its posting status to <uicontrol>Completed</uicontrol>.
If you choose the <uicontrol>Post and Do Not Complete</uicontrol> button, the system posts the bank statement item on account and sets its posting status to <uicontrol>Auto-Posted on Account</uicontrol>.
Show Script
Converts the conditions and validations or substitutions into a script.
Converts your specified conditions and validations or substitutions into a script encapsulating the logic in a format that is both processable by computer and comprehensible to humans.
This is particularly helpful for complex rules.
The relationships between filters are as follows:
Filters for different fields have an <xref id="lockTU_4300ac54-afe6-442d-9c2b-d6fa7b45a028"/> logic between each other.
Filters for a same field have an <xref id="lockTU_348147eb-e2cb-41aa-8f3c-fda8d6bf137c"/> logic between each other.
There is an exception:
Filters using a negative operator, such as <xref id="lockTU_781ea643-799e-4dc0-a314-2eaf33acef56"/>, have an <xref id="lockTU_bdd3ad32-848f-4e1b-b93c-30edabedab49"/> logic with the filters that use positive operators.
Schedule Job
Schedule jobs to open and close posting periods
Use
Allows you to schedule a background job to open and close posting periods.
You can schedule single runs, repeated runs, or initiate an immediate run.
As part of the runs, you can indicate the period status for the previous, current, next period.
You can then view the scheduled jobs and job results using the <uicontrol>Display Scheduled Jobs</uicontrol> button.
Allocation Cycle
Summary of rules and settings that enable allocations.
Definition
Allocation cycles summarize the rules and settings to enable an allocation to occur.
An allocation cycle consists of header data and one or more allocation segments that are processed together.
You create allocation cycles in the <uicontrol>Manage Allocations</uicontrol> app.
You run allocation cycles in the <uicontrol>Run Allocations</uicontrol> app.
Use
The header data of the allocation cycle contains information valid for all allocation segments contained in the cycle.
Within a cycle, you can define several allocation segments.
In an allocation segment, you define the rules by which an allocation is performed.
You can perform all allocation transactions in one cycle or define several cycles that are then processed in the order in which they were entered.
This ensures that each cycle is processed in full before the next cycle is executed.
Variance in Percent
Defines the possible counting variance as a general setting in the physical inventory process.
Definition
Defines the possible percentage variance between the counted quantity and the book quantity, above which the system is to issue a warning message when you press save.
Use
Enter a value if you want to be notified of inventory differences based on count results.
You can enter percentage values between <userinput>1</userinput> and <userinput>999</userinput> in the <uicontrol>Variance in Percent</uicontrol> field.
Note that the app does not allow entries that differ from this specification.
Despite the warning message, you can still save the entries.
UIs and Reports
The extensible UIs and reports for a selected business context
In addition to the details, you can navigate to the corresponding apps from:
<uicontrol>UI Name</uicontrol> - navigate to the <uicontrol>SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library</uicontrol>.
This is where you can find the details about a Fiori app
<uicontrol>Custom Fields Added</uicontrol> - navigate to the <uicontrol>Custom Fields and Logic</uicontrol> app.
This is where you can create or view details about custom fields
Reject All Items
Reject all items in a sales inquiry.
Use
To reject all items in a sales inquiry, you first have to select a sales inquiry and then choose <uicontrol>Reject All Items</uicontrol>.
You also have to select a reason for the rejection.
Note
The rejection reason of an item that has already been rejected for another reason remains unchanged.
Access Level
Specifies the level on which you want to share the template.
Use
Selecting an access level determines the user group that can view and use this template.
The following access levels are available to choose when you create a template.
10 (Group Level)
20 (Company Code Level)
30 (User Level)
If you choose <uicontrol>30 (User Level)</uicontrol> for a template, it can't be shared publicly and can be accessed only by the template creator.
Contract in Preparation
Enables you to save a purchase contract without releasing it.
Use
You can use this option to temporarily save purchase contracts without releasing it.
For example, while creating a purchase contract, if you need to exit the contract creation process to double-check and clarify certain details, you can select <uicontrol>Contract in Preparation</uicontrol>.
You can then save your current progress even if there are errors due to incomplete entry fields.
You only need to ensure that you specified a contract type.
Change Roles
Change the role for a process step.
A business user can be maintained in the <uicontrol>Manage User</uicontrol> section of the <uicontrol>Test Your Processes</uicontrol> app.
A business user is required to execute a process step.
In <uicontrol>Manage Your Test Processes</uicontrol>, each process step can have a different role.
The role is linked to a business user.
Therefore, if the <uicontrol>Role</uicontrol> field is left empty, a test process cannot be executed.
Use the value help to select a role.
However, if you want to add a new role while editing the role, click <uicontrol>Create</uicontrol> in the <uicontrol>Select Role</uicontrol> window.
A new window opens in the <uicontrol>Test Your Processes</uicontrol> app that allows you to add a new test user.
When you create a new user, make sure that the new user is maintained with all required roles—including the roles needed to access the test tool (<userinput>SAP_BR_ADMIN_TEST_AUTOMATION </userinput>)—so that the user can execute a process step.
Data Slice
A user-defined data subset of a data source
Represents a user-defined data subset of a data source.
For each matching rule, you define two data slices by using filter fields derived from the relevant data source.
In this way, the matching rule only acts on the data restricted by the two data slices.
If items from each data slice match, the items from data slice 1 are tagged with value “1” for the field <xref id="lockTU_f3a97f1d-2ed5-45ff-afa8-b05bc2e02d8f"/> (<uicontrol>Data Slice</uicontrol>) in the database table <xref id="lockTU_e75ebc78-765f-4a7e-b022-2568727ebe02"/> (<uicontrol>Matching Entries</uicontrol>) while items from data slice 2 tagged with “2”.
If the two data slices intersect, the items in the intersection are tagged with “1”.
It is recommended not to have intersections between the two data slices.
For example, you can define a matching rule that has accounts receivable (AR) items in slice 1 and accounts payable (AP) items in slice 2.
Then the matching result will clearly show you all AR items grouped under the company and AP items grouped under the trading partner.
However, if your matching rule has both AR and AP items in one slice, you may see the matching result groups AR and AP items all into the slice 1 (leading unit side).
Split Components
Shows how the COGS were split.
Use
Under <uicontrol>Split Components</uicontrol>, you find detailed information about how the cost of goods sold was split between the cost components:
<uicontrol>Journal Entry Amounts</uicontrol>:
Shows how the total cost is split between the cost components
<uicontrol>Cost Estimate</uicontrol>:
Shows the cost component structure
<uicontrol>Mapping</uicontrol>:
Shows how the cost components are mapped to target accounts
Origin Acceptance
Enables you to indicate if the acceptance of an ordered item is to take place at the point of origin.
Use
You can indicate if the acceptance of an ordered item is to take place at the point of origin (that is, on the supplier's premises) by selecting <uicontrol>Origin Acceptance</uicontrol> for the specific item.
If you set the indicator, you must post the goods receipt to the valuated GR blocked stock using the movement type 107 as soon as the goods have been accepted at the supplier's facility.
In a second step, you can post the goods from valuated GR blocked stock to unrestricted-use stock using movement type 109 as soon as the goods have been delivered by the supplier.
You cannot change this indicator in the item of the purchase scheduling agreement after you have posted a follow-on document (goods receipt, invoice receipt) for the item.
Add a Space
Create a new space.
Create a new space.
Spaces are environments that bring data models, connections, compute and storage resources together for a specific line of business or use-case.
Enter a name for your space.
The name should be unique within a space.
An ID is assigned, but you can edit it if needed.
Select <uicontrol>Create</uicontrol>.
Select the total storage you want to assign to your space (disk) as well as how much disk storage you want to be able to be leveraged as in-memory storage.
If 2 GB has been assigned as disk storage and 1 GB as in-memory, for example, your in-memory accelleration is at 50%.
The maximum storage that can be assigned is 4 GB.
Save.
Set your space priority.
Queries from an important space are prioritized and are, thus, processed faster than queries of a space with a lower priority.
1 is the lowest and 5 the highest priority.
Assign one or multiple users via <uicontrol>+</uicontrol>.
Click <uicontrol>OK</uicontrol> to save.
Only these users will be able to see and work inside your space.
If you cannot find a user in the list, you should first create a user.
Go to <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol> → <uicontrol>Users</uicontrol> in the left panel.
For more information on connecting to sources and assigning a connection to your space see the Connections help tab.

Use
When changes are made to a project, data regarding the changes are saved in the <uicontrol>Change Log</uicontrol>.
You can select which changes you want to view in the change log by selecting the parameters in the change log settings.
By default, the system displays the change Field Name, New Value, Old Value, Created By, Created On and Change Type.
You can also select further change data to be displayed depending on your requirements.
Views
You can save your personalized settings as a view with a unique name.
Use
When you start the app the first time, the list is displayed according to the default settings delivered by SAP.
You can set filters to narrow down the list.
You can save your settings as a view with a unique name by choosing the <uicontrol>Select View</uicontrol> button next to the name of the current view to open the view management functions.
You can decide to set your view as the new default view.
You can also decide to make the view public so that it is available for everyone who has access to the app.
If you decide to apply your view automatically, it is applied immediately whenever it is selected.
You do not need to click the <uicontrol>Go</uicontrol> button in the filter bar.
Be aware that this option might result in long loading times.
You can create a tile for your view.
Depending on whether you work with the home page or with spaces and pages, you can select where the tile shall be added.
For the home page, you select one or more groups.
For spaces and pages, you select one or more pages.
First, the tile is added to the <uicontrol>Recently Added Apps</uicontrol> section of this page.
You can drag the app to your preferred section.
The view is saved even if you cancel the creation of the tile.
To view the app without your personalized settings, choose the <uicontrol>Standard</uicontrol> view.
As soon as you change the layout, the system displays a star next to the name.
Quality Information
The performance of the model version is evaluated using two main indicators.
The performance of the model version is evaluated using two main indicators: predictive power and the predictive confidence.
Predictive power is the quality indicator of a model version.
Predictive confidence is the robustness indicator of a model version.
The two values are combined into a quality star rating.
The star symbols are rated 1 to 5.
(One - five stars, with five stars indicating the best quality).
The <uicontrol>Predictive Models</uicontrol> app evaluates the quality of the model version, in terms of its predictive confidence and predictive power.
This quality indicator helps to decide whether or not to use the model version to make predictions.
Job Status
Status of background job
Indicates the current status of the background job.
The job status only applies to background jobs.
If no job status is shown, this is because the corresponding costing step is executed online.
In most cases the job status refers to the costing step corresponding to the costing run status.
Costing Run Status:
<uicontrol>Marked</uicontrol>
Job Status:
<uicontrol>Finished</uicontrol>
This means the background job has finished processing the <uicontrol>Marking</uicontrol> step.
Base Currency

If you add more than one transporter, you must specify which is the default transporter.
Verify Release Compatibility
Verify the release compatibility of an existing custom test process.
After a system upgrade or a new release, when there is a significant change in the app used by the custom test process step, the test execution can be affected.
Therefore, it is marked as non compatible or <uinolabel>To be Verified by User</uinolabel>.
You must adapt the custom test process as per the changes in the application.
After verifying the business process step execution manually and finding it compatible, you can set the status to <uinolabel>Verified by User</uinolabel>.
To verify, in edit mode, click the <uinolabel>To be Verified by User</uinolabel> icon in the <uicontrol>Release Compatibility</uicontrol> column of a process step.
Include Exposure from Finance
Decide to include the credit exposure from Finance (Y/N).
Decides whether the exposure from Finance is included in the calculated credit limit utilization (Y/N).
<emphasis>Recommended</emphasis>:
Always fill this field with the standard value <userinput>Y</userinput>.
Possible entries:
<userinput>Y</userinput>:
Yes, the credit exposures from Finance and from Sales and Distribution are included in the credit limit utilization.
<userinput>N</userinput> or any other value:
No, the credit exposure from Finance is not included in the calculated credit limit utilization.
Only the credit exposure from Sales and Distribution is included.
Delivery Address
Define the delivery address for the sourcing project.
Definition
Define the address where the suppliers need to deliver ordered goods and services, such as a plant address or storage location.
Use
The delivery address is the address where the suppliers need to deliver the ordered materials or services.
This can be the address of a plant or a storage location.
How the delivery address is specified depends on whether a sourcing project is created from scratch or created due to actions performed in a different app.
The <uicontrol>Delivery Address</uicontrol> facet is only available at the item level of items of the type <uicontrol>Standard Item</uicontrol>.
Creating a sourcing project from scratch
When creating a sourcing project from scratch, the delivery address can be generated automatically or specified manually:
The delivery address can be generated automatically once you enter the company code.
The system then automatically determines the connected system.
By entering the plant number, the system is then able to automatically generate a default address on the UI using the plant and the connected system.
The generated default address can overwritten by the user if necessary.
The delivery address can also be specified manually:
You can edit an automatically generated address.
You can manually enter a delivery address.
You can use the value help that is available for the <uicontrol>Name</uicontrol> field and select one of the available entries.
The data that has previously been defined for the selected entry is then copied into the <uicontrol>Delivery Address</uicontrol> section.
You can, however, still manually edit the data if necessary.
Creating a sourcing project from a purchase requisition
If you create a sourcing project from a purchase requisition and the system has copied a delivery address from the purchase requisition into the sourcing project, you can either use that address or change it manually.
Here, too, you can either manually enter a different address or use the value help to select one of the available entries.
f(x)
Enables you to get required output from the formulas.
This function enables you to get required output from the left or right formula.
The following functions are available:
<uicontrol>ABS</uicontrol>:
Outputs an absolute value of the calculated value with 2 decimal places.
<uicontrol>Sign</uicontrol>:
Outputs 1 if the calculated value is positive, zero (0) if the value is 0, and -1 if the value is negative.
<uicontrol>Round (0)</uicontrol>:
Rounds the calculated value to the nearest single digit.
<uicontrol>Round (1)</uicontrol>:
Rounds the calculated value to one decimal place.
<uicontrol>Round (2)</uicontrol>:
Rounds the calculated value to two decimal places.
Mark Actions as Optional
Make an action optional for the test plan execution.
Use the toggle button to mark an action as optional.
Optional action means that an action is executed only if it can be performed on the UI.
If the action is optional, its execution status does not affect the process step status.
Let us assume that in a process step, there are 10 actions and the fifth action is optional.
During the test execution, if the fifth action cannot be performed, the remaining actions continue to be executed.
If all subsequent actions are executed successfully, the process step status is switched to <uicontrol>Success</uicontrol>.
Create New Order
Create a planned order manually.
Use
You create a planned order manually, for example, if you want to procure materials independently of requirements.
To create a planned order manually, you choose <uicontrol>Create New Order</uicontrol>, select a planned order profile, and enter, for example, which material should be procured, the MRP area, the quantity of material to be procured, the date on which you want it to be available and whether it is to be procured externally or internally.
If it is a planned order for a material produced in-house, you can explode the BOM manually and adjust the material components.
You can also enter or change the additional information, for example:
The goods receipt processing time for materials
The BOM explosion number
The production version
In planned orders for materials produced in-house or by subcontracting, you can also do the following:
Access the component overview and adjust he material components in the component overview
Explode the BOM manually
Check the availability of the components of the planned order
Schedule the planned order (in-house production only)
Export Scenarios
Let's you switch the development system for workflow scenario content.
When you transport workflow scenario content from the development to the production system, the content in the production system is overridden.
Exporting workflow scenario content is primarily intended as a one-time action to import content from the production into the development system.
After you have exported workflow scenario content from a production system, you can no longer modify the content in that system because from then on the content development is done in the development system.
If you export the workflow scenario content for some other reason, you can re-enable the content for modification afterwards.
See the <xref format="html" href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2853263" scope="external">SAP Note 2853263</xref>.
Create Software Collection
Create software collections according to your business needs.
Items that are semantically related can be stored in a dedicated software collection.
The collection must also include all dependencies.
Once exported, an item stays in the software collection for its entire lifecycle.
However, there may be exceptions, for instance, when you create a dependency to an item in a different software collection.
In such cases you may use the <uicontrol>Move Items</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Merge</uicontrol> feature.
The Move Items feature moves an item and all its dependencies (used and using) to another software collection.
The Merge feature merges all items of one software collection into another software collection.
Create Event
Allows you to create a new maintenance event
Definition
Allows you to create a new maintenance event.
Use
To create a new maintenance event, choose the maintenance event type.
Depending on how the event types have been configured, the system will automatically create an administrative maintenance order and assign it to the maintenance event.
The administrative maintenance order allows you to plan the maintenance work and block the production capacity of the technical object on which the maintenance is performed.
If you choose a maintenance event type that has been configured for the creation of an administrative maintenance order, an additional dropdown list is displayed from which you can select a system condition.
To block the production capacity of the asset, choose <userinput>not in operation</userinput>.
The system condition is copied to the administrative maintenance order and cannot be edited.
You can also specify a maintenance event ID in the <uicontrol>Maintenance Event</uicontrol> field.
If you don't enter an ID, the ID is generated by the system.
The administrative maintenance order is created in the system once you create or save the planning bucket.
Incompleteness Info
Check your sales order for missing data.
Definition
A sales order is incomplete if required information is missing.
The configuration expert defines which data is required for your sales document in your organization (for example, the terms of payment because they are necessary for billing).
Note that you don't always have to provide missing data right away.
In some cases, it might only be possible to provide the data at a later point in time.
Use
You can check your sales order for any missing data and, where necessary, provide this data.
One or more warning messages at the bottom of your screen direct you to the required fields that are not filled yet.
Not all the fields that have been defined as required by your company might be available in this app.
From the related apps, you can choose to change incomplete data.
This opens up the incompletion log in the <uicontrol>Change Sales Orders - VA02</uicontrol> app where you can find out which data is still missing and complete it.
Control Characteristics
Use to define characteristics for business document class sales orders.
Use the <uicontrol>Control Characteristics</uicontrol> section to find, display, edit, copy, and remove the control characteristics that have been defined for the business document class <uicontrol>sales order</uicontrol>.
The <uicontrol>Ordinal Number</uicontrol> column denotes the sequence of the characteristics.
Standard buttons are available for:
Adding a control characteristic
Removing a selected control characteristic
Changing the order of the control characteristic
Note that these buttons are displayed only when the control characteristics are in edit mode.
The <uicontrol>Remove</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Move Up</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Move Down</uicontrol> buttons are active only when one control characteristic is selected.
Furthermore, removing or re-ordering characteristics may lead to data loss - proceed with caution.
Characteristic Attribute
Specifies whether a qualitative characteristic requires the reference to a characteristic attribute
Use
This control indicator is relevant for qualitative characteristics only.
It specifies whether a qualitative characteristic requires the reference to a characteristic attribute.
If this indicator is set, the inspection characteristic is marked as an attributive characteristic, whose allowed values are defined under <uicontrol>Catalogs</uicontrol> as a selected set of catalog type <uicontrol>Characteristic Attributes</uicontrol>.
If this indicator is not set, the inspection characteristic is marked as an alternative characteristic that can only take the values "Accepted" or "Rejected".
Work Item
Lists the types of work performed in the work package.
Definition
Indicates the type of work that is performed during the delivery of a service.
Work items can be used to influence pricing and billing of services.
Use
You use work items to plan detailed work assignments, and divide responsibility between assigned resources.
You can do the following in a work package:
Select from a pre-defined list by searching for a work item or by using work item group as a filter to display related work items.
Key users can set up pre-defined work items and work item groups in the app <cite>Define Work Items and Groups</cite> under <menucascade><uicontrol>Manage Your Solution</uicontrol><uicontrol>Configure Your Solution</uicontrol><uicontrol>Professional Services</uicontrol></menucascade>.
Create user-defined work items.
View work items assigned to the work package.
Delete or deactivate a work item from a work package, by deselecting the checkbox in the edit mode.
The work item is deleted from the work package if it is not assigned to a resource and no actual postings exist.
If the work item is assigned to a resource or if actual postings exist, the work item becomes inactive and further time recording is not possible.
Activate a work item to allow assignments to resources and time recording.
Price Simulation
Enables you to simulate a price for a purchase contract item.
Use
You can simulate the price for a particular purchase contract item for a given date.
To do this, navigate to the <uicontrol>Price Simulation</uicontrol> section under the <uicontrol>Conditions</uicontrol> facet.
Provide all the mandatory details such as the Pricing Date, Currency, Quantity, Plant and choose <uicontrol>Simulate</uicontrol>.
This simulates the price of the particular item for the specified date period.
Maintain a pricing scale for purchase contract item.
When you create a condition record for a pricing element, you can define a pricing scale.
For example, a scale based on quantity can determine that the more a user orders of a particular product, the lower the price.
You can create condition records with quantity or value scales based on the configuration of the condition type.
A pricing scale can be based on value or quantity criteria types.
In each condition record where you define a scale value, you can further specify the scale type.
The scale type determines whether the scale is a From-scale or a To-scale.
For example, if you specify a From-scale that is based on quantity, the scale determines different prices based on different quantities.
You can add or delete scales for items conditions depending on configuration of condition types in central purchase contract items.
Export

It enables you to identify unfinished and unknown payments in time.
It also helps you get rid of duplicated items in forecasts to gain a more accurate account of your cash positions.
Contract for Limit
Enables you to enter the number of a purchase contract for the service limit.
You can use a purchase contract for limit in the following scenario, for example:
You want to engage a service provider to repair a machine, but you do not yet know which services are required in detail.
In a <emphasis>purchase contract</emphasis>, you define the potential set of services, that may be required, for example, for the maintenance and repair of a particular machine.
In the <emphasis>purchase order</emphasis> item, you create a limit item with product type group <cite>Service</cite>.
You define the limit amounts (<cite>Overall Limit</cite> and <cite>Expected Value</cite>) and you assign the purchase contract to this limit by entering the number of the contract into the <uicontrol>Contract for Limit</uicontrol> field as the source of supply.
In the service entry sheet that refers to this purchase order limit item, the number of the purchase contract is inserted automatically and the purchaser can select the relevant service items from the assigned contract.
This ensures, that your company benefits from the prices negotiated in the purchase contract.
Generate File
Use this feature to generate a word file or a PDF file from a legal document.
To use this feature, you can select the required legal document from the list view, choose the <uicontrol>Generate File</uicontrol> button in the menu and select either <uicontrol>Generate Word File</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Generate PDF File</uicontrol>.
You can then provide the folder in which you want the generated file to be saved.
The file type of the generated legal document can be seen in the <uicontrol>File Type</uicontrol> field of a legal document object.
You can even set the corresponding value for these file types while using the Assembly Automation Levels during the creation of virtual documents.
For more information about how to set the automatic level, refer to <xref keyref="loio4f96fbd3d03240b2a73c44a88e18938b"/>.
Placeholders
In the <uicontrol>Subject</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Body HTML</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Body Text </uicontrol> fields of the email template, you can use placeholders that render values from fields in Core Data Services (CDS) views.
The placeholders must use the following syntax:
<emphasis>{{<field name>}}</emphasis>.
The text "The price is {{Amount}} {{Currency}}" contains two placeholders, one for the Amount field and one for the Currency field.
If the Amount field in the corresponding CDS view has the value 42 and the Currency field has the value EUR, the resulting text is "The price is 42 EUR".
If you select <uicontrol>Show Data Fields</uicontrol>, a list of all the available fields with description is displayed .
Placeholder Details
Field names
Make sure that you only include existing field names in the placeholders.
If a placeholder uses a field name that does not exist in the CDS view, no field value is rendered.
For example, the text "This is an invalid field name {{NonExistingField}}" is rendered as "This is an invalid field name {{NonExistingField}}".
Formatting
Dates and numbers are formatted according to the user settings of the user who executes the API.
The text "Today is {{CurrentDate}}" referring to the field <xref id="lockTU_1aa4b19d-21c1-486e-9774-7921b56a4eab"/> with the value <userinput>20141130</userinput> is rendered as<systemoutput> Today is 30.11.2014</systemoutput> for a German user.
Dangerous Goods
Carry out tasks related to dangerous goods.
Assign active compliance purposes for dangerous goods to products.
Compliance purposes (collection of relevant dangerous goods compliance requirements from the issuing authorities) must have already been created in Product Compliance before you can assign them here.
After you have assigned unpackaged and/or packaged products and a valid dangerous goods purpose and then saved, the product assessments from the relevant compliance requirements are generated if the product has all three of the following logistics roles assigned: emission relevant, transported, and disposed.
An assessment for a packaged product is only available after the corresponding assessment for the unpackaged product has been released.
Before a product assessment can be used in transport documents, it must be released by a user with the role of <uicontrol>Dangerous Goods Specialist – Product Compliance</uicontrol> in the <uicontrol>My Unpackaged Dangerous Goods</uicontrol> and the <uicontrol>My Packaged Dangerous Goods</uicontrol> apps.

Allocation Type
Summary of processes that take place during allocation.
Definition
Allocation types are a summary of the processes that can take place during allocation.
You can select an allocation type when creating an allocation cycle in the <uicontrol>Manage Allocations</uicontrol> app.
Depending on your use case, you can choose between the following types of allocations:
<uicontrol>Distribution</uicontrol>
In distribution, amounts and quantities of one or more sender objects are distributed to one or more receiver objects, from service cost centers to production cost centers, for example.
The G/L account postings for the distribution occur under the original account/original cost element with which the amounts and quantities are posted at the sender.
The information of the original account/original cost element remains intact.
You can carry out distribution with both actual and plan data.
<uicontrol>Overhead Allocation</uicontrol>
With overhead allocation, the amounts are posted to separate overhead allocation accounts rather than to the original accounts.
These overhead allocation accounts bundle actual/plan data posted on various primary accounts and give them a new meaning.
The information from the original account/original cost element is lost.
Overhead allocations are performed if the original composition of the actual/plan data does not contain any important information for the receiver but the label of the overhead allocation account does.
<uicontrol>Top-down Distribution</uicontrol>
You use top-down distribution to distribute aggregated amounts and quantities to a more detailed level based on reference information.
For example, freight invoices cannot easily be assigned to the product level.
Therefore, you post it at a summarized level, such as the product group, and then use top-down distribution to distribute the amounts to a more detailed level, such as the product, by using sales revenue for each product as a reference.
Set to In Progress
Set document status to in progress.
Use
You can use this button to change a finalized preliminary document's status to in progress.
Once it has changed status, you can make changes by using the <xref keyref="loioe11c1fd6ef74449e90fed9428d0d1dde"/> app.

Number of Retries
Specify, if and how often a job is repeated, in case it has been aborted before.
You can determine, if at all a job is rescheduled and how often this is retried.
The default value is <xref id="lockTU_5cdffe63-e33b-4e0d-ac02-4ee7f80be0f5"/>.
You have to overwrite this, to define a retry.
Only jobs that had been aborted, are repeated.
Here you can specify how often this is done.
Usually a job run for orders is aborted because an order is locked by another user at the time of the job run and because the <uicontrol>Reset Availability Data</uicontrol> checkbox had been selected for that job run.
In this case no changes are made to any of the selected orders of that run.
The job is aborted.
For this particular case, you can specify the <uicontrol>Number of Retries</uicontrol>.
The system will rerun the job according to the defined number and interval.
If the <uicontrol>Reset Availability Data</uicontrol> checkbox is not selected, the system ignores the orders that are locked by another user for the job run.
The job is not aborted.
Changes are made to all orders except the locked ones.

That means, you can define how the rule should reprocess incomplete bank statement items for the first posting step.
Use
In the first posting step, you can have the reprocessing rule post bank statement items to subaccounts.
In order to do that, you need to select <userinput>002 (Two-Step Posting)</userinput> as the value of the <uicontrol>Procedure Type</uicontrol> field and provide a subaccount number in the <uicontrol>Bank Subaccount</uicontrol> field to which the system should post the bank statement item in the first posting step.
If you do not want the reprocessing rule to trigger a two-step posting procedure, select <userinput>001 (One-Step Posting)</userinput> as the value of the <uicontrol>Procedure Type</uicontrol> field and leave the <uicontrol>Bank Subaccount</uicontrol> field empty.
Adjust Item
Make a time-based adjustment to the item amount.
To change the item amount that is due on a specific date or dates, select your item, then create an adjustment by choosing <uicontrol>Adjust Item</uicontrol>.
Enter the difference amount (either a positive or negative amount) and an adjustment reason, then save.
This creates an adjustment item.
The amount billed is the sum of the main item amount and any related adjustment item amounts.
You can create more than one adjustment for a billing plan item, but you cannot create an adjustment for an adjustment item.

DSO
Days Sales Outstanding:
Number of days a customer takes to pay, expressed in sales days.
Definition
Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) is a key figure about the number of days a customer takes to pay an invoice, expressed in sales days.
It’s the number of days it takes on average for your company to collect your receivables from a customer.
A high Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) figure can indicate that your company is taking too long to collect money, and that your company is extending too lenient credit terms to customers.
Calculation
The <emphasis>DSO</emphasis> is calculated as follows:
The current balance is divided by the quotient of the sales of the period, and the period.
<alt>For the calculation of the DSO, the current balance is divided by the quotient of the sales of the period, and the period.</alt>
The <emphasis>period</emphasis> is the number of sales days of the last 3 months, plus the number of sales days of the current month.
For example:
The current date is February 3, 2021.
The start of the period that is considered for the DSO calculation is November 1, 2020.
The end of the period that is considered for the DSO calculation is February 3, 2021.
As a result, 95 days are considered for the DSO calculation.

If you confirm that a system-determined validation status is not correct, you can manually change the status to <uicontrol>Marked as Correct</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Marked as Error</uicontrol>.
You can do so on a single item or multiple ones.
Once an item is set to <uicontrol>Marked as Correct</uicontrol> or <uicontrol>Marked as Error</uicontrol>, the status remains so and will not be overwritten by system-determined status after the condition is changed and you choose the <uicontrol>Refresh Status</uicontrol> button again.
An item is in status <uicontrol>Not Determined</uicontrol> because there is no condition assigned.
You set this item to <uicontrol>Marked as Correct</uicontrol>.
Later you assign a condition to this item and then choose the <uicontrol>Refresh Status</uicontrol> again.
However, the status remains as <uicontrol>Marked as Correct</uicontrol> because the manually set status always has priority over system-determined status.
