Making Selections in the Data Replication Monitor
Filter replication records to be shown in the Data Replication Monitor by various attributes, such as replication status, replication time, or specific selection criteria such as the employee's company or location.
If you want to filter for the replication status, select the status or statuses you are interested in.
If you want to filter for more attributes, enter one or more of the following criteria:
A country or multiple countries
This returns data replication records for all employees who, according to their Job Information, are located in one of the selected countries.
You're shown here all countries corresponding to the legal entities that are active in your instance.
A company or multiple companies
This returns data replication records for all employees whose Job Information contains one of the selected companies.
The list of companies shown here varies, depending on the country or countries you select.
If you deselect a country, the companies belonging to this country are also removed from the dropdown list, even if you had selected them before.
If you select the country again, the companies of this country are added to the dropdown list again, but are unselected.
The employees' location
An employee class
The employees' pay group
This returns data replication records for all employees whose Compensation Information matches the selected pay group criteria.
A replication target system
This returns data replication records for all employees for which the middleware sent a notification or confirmation containing the corresponding replication target system.
You can choose from all Replication Target System objects that were created in your Employee Central instance (in Admin Center, using the Manage Data tool).
The replication content type
The Data Replication Monitor also shows data replication records for inactive employees (such as terminated or retired employees) and for employees to be hired in the future â€“ if they match your selection criteria.
It considers Personal Information, Compensation Information, and Job Information of the employees in question.
If you want to filter for the replication time, select one of the time options.
The Data Replication Monitor uses the time stamp from your browser and converts it to the correct time zone of the database.
The default Replication Time selection is Last 15 Minutes, but you can use other options such as Last Hour or Last 24 Hours.
You can also enter a specific time frame.
Selecting a time option returns data replication records for all employees with a confirmation time stamp (shown in Last Replicated At) that is within this time frame.
If you choose All Until Now, all data replication records for the filter criteria you've specified are shown.
The Data Replication Monitor includes the current time slice, plus future time slices using the system high date (December 31, 9999).
Choose Apply to show the result list of all data replication records matching your selection.
The number of entries that can be shown by the Data Replication Monitor is limited to 10,000.
If the number of results matching your selection exceeds this limit, you are shown a warning.
The monitor then displays a reduced results list.
You can work with this list as usual.
But we recommend that you adjust your filter conditions in this case, in order to show all data replication records that match your selection.

A personnel number that is generated during a failed replication run is retained and then reused in the next replication run.
Employees with the employment status Retired should not be filtered out in data replication from
Terminated and Retired were previously listed as examples of employement statuses you can use to filter out time slices when an employee is inactive.
We removed Retired from this list.
New program available for mass-deletion of queries
You can now mass-delete queries with the type Employee-Specific Query and the statuses Successful or Failed regularly, to clean up the query administration tables and minimize the number of records in these tables.

Adding information about the BAdI: <locked-ref>
When additional actions are maintained in the ERP system for the core hybrid scenarios, and also replicated from EC system, you can now avoid the deletion of the additional actions by implementing the ECPAO_IN_NO_MASS_DELETION BAdI.
Courses, Classes, Curricula, Programs Explainer
Courses, Classes, Curricula, and Programs
A course is similar to a math course you find in a university course catalog: the university tracks your progress in the course and grades you when you complete your exams.
In, your learning administrator tracks your completion in a course (for example, workplace safety).
A class is similar to one scheduled math course at a university: it can be offered on Mondays at 10 AM and on Wednesdays at 6 PM.
You can attend either one and earn credit.
In, your learning administrator wants to know which of the scheduled workplace safety courses you attended.
A curriculum is similar to a degree in the university: if you earn your degree in mathematics, you have taken a number of required math courses and some elective courses.
In, a curriculum is smaller than a university degree, but it has similar rules and requirements, and you cannot complete the curriculum until you have completed your required courses.
For example, the workplace safety course can be part of a larger Safety and Security Basics curriculum that covers workplace safety, computer security, building security, and travel safety.
A program is like a curriculum except that it accounts for its hours differently and uses different rules to determine which courses you take.
Programs are often informal groups of courses.
Filtering Learning Opportunities
These filters help you refine your search results so that you can find specific learning opportunities.
When you find courses, you can make the results more specific with these search filters.
You see the filters when you search or browse for learning opportunities.
Search Filters
Filter Name
Description
Category
The category describes whether you can take a course online, whether there is an instructor and therefore a scheduled time for it, or whether the course of learning is actually a set of courses bundled into a curriculum.
Subject Area
Subject areas categorize the content of the course.
Source
The source describes where the course originated.
For example: internal courses and external courses.
Delivery Method
Delivery method is a more specific categorization than category.
It describes how the course is conducted.
For example, online, in a conference, in a virtual session, and so on.
Language
The language that the course is conducted in. Use the language filter to find courses in your native language.
Search Text
Your search text filters the results to courses that match what you type into the search box.
Default Learning Reports
The reports available to you can vary depending on the configuration of your system.
These reports are available by default.
When you run a report, the system consolidates information from a variety of areas into a single report, which allows you to perform a targeted analysis of key data.
This table contains only learning reports, not legacy reports.
Report Name
Purpose
Competency Assessment Comparison
You can use the Competency Assessment Comparison report to compare the competency ratings for a user with the organization average and the company average.
If a user is assigned a competency, but has not yet been rated for that competency, then the report excludes that user for that competency.
Competency Assessment Trend
Supervisors use the Competency Assessment Trend report to see if the competency ratings of their direct reports have improved or declined over time.
Each user could have up to five competency ratings for each competency.
For example, if you select 3 Months from the Historical Trend Interval list, then the first (most recent) competency rating appears in the Current Rating column; the second competency rating appears in the Last Rating column; and the third, fourth, and fifth competency ratings appear in the Historical Trend column.
Curriculum Status
As a supervisor, you can use the Curriculum Status report to review which users have fallen behind on completing their assigned curricula.
Employee/Supervisor Ratings Gap
You can use Employee/Supervisor Ratings Gap report to show users whose self rating was significantly different from their supervisorâ€™s rating (you define the significance of the gap using Gap Threshold).
The gap can be positive or negative: the supervisor can have the higher or the lower rating of the two.
The report shows all gaps from the most recent performance review.
Item Requests
As a supervisor or learning coordinator, you can use the Item Requests report to identify which items might require an additional scheduled offering to meet current demands or needs.
Item Status
You can run the Item Status report to show the completion dates and statuses for items in the learning history.
Learning History
As a supervisor, you can use the Learning History report to list all of the items that your direct or indirect reports have completed.
You can use this report to compare each userâ€™s performance and their status for the item.
Learning Hours
You can run the Learning Hours report to display the details for events in the user learning history that include course length, credit hours, CPE hours, and contact hours.
Learning Needs
You can run the Learning Needs report to view the assigned items that remain on a userâ€™s to-do list.
This report can be filtered to show only required learning.
Learning Plan
You can run the Learning Plan report to display all of the items a user has been assigned.
This report includes completion dates where applicable, and it can be filtered to show only learning needs or required assignments.
Tuition
The Tuition report displays the amount the user paid in order to launch, register, or complete an item.
User Information
The User Information report shows basic information about each user.
You can use this report, for example, to troubleshoot some common issues, such as ensuring that users have email addresses when they say that they are not receiving email notifications.
Password Security
The password-based approach of authentication can be used to protect applications when the following advice is taken into consideration.
Description
Passwords are a familiar way to verify the identity of users and systems.
Passwords are simpler and cheaper than other, more secure forms of authentication like smart cards or biometric scanners.
They provide a simple, direct means of protecting a system or an account.
However, there are also known weaknesses.
Password cracking is the process of figuring out or breaking passwords in order to gain unauthorized access to a system or an account.
Many passwords are not random but trivial to guess.
A more technical way of cracking passwords is through network sniffers, which look at the raw data transmitted across the network and decipher its contents, including passwords.
Furthermore, attackers can try to crack passwords offline when they can access the hashed password string during transmission or in an insecure password store.
What Do I Get from Application Server?
The overall process of password-based identification and authentication is as follows.
First, the application asks for the user identification, usually the user's account name.
Then the password is read and a hash-value of the password is calculated.
Often a salt, that is a random string of data, is added in order to prevent an attacker from testing known dictionary words.
Some password components also wipe the memory in which the password was stored.
Finally, the system checks whether the hashed user input and the stored hash value of the password match.
If they do, the user is successfully authenticated.
( AS) provides authentication mechanism of the type described above.
We recommend that, in general, you use the existing password authentication mechanism provided by AS instead of implementing one of your own.
What Do I Need to Do?
The issues described above necessitate that you handle user IDs and passwords carefully.
The following recommendations may help to prevent an unauthorized person gaining access to your system:
Are passwords displayed in plain text?
Do not display passwords in plain text, use asterisks instead
Are passwords saved or transmitted in plain text?
Passwords transmitted in plain text can be intercepted, rendering the user ID and password method of identification insecure.
It is better to transmit passwords using the Secure Network Communications (SNC) protocol.
Do not save passwords in plain text.
Avoid the administrator gaining access to the password.
Use secure hash functions to prevent password recovery.
AS uses secure hash values to store passwords.
Do not invent your own coding to encrypt the original password.
Are passwords hard-coded in the source code?
Use a technology such as one-time passwords.
Apply a changeable password in a central function, such as Configuration of RFC Connections (transaction <locked-ref> ).
Do not invent your own encryption algorithm.
Are passwords recorded in log, protocol, or trace files?
Do not use requests since all parameters can be found in the URL.
Use requests instead.
In general, you should avoid transmitting passwords, in particular with every request you send.
Use secure mechanisms, such as digital certificates, instead.
Take into account that the web server logs all the URLs.
Passwords may also be displayed in readable form when tracing, depending on the trace settings.
Are passwords in plain text overwritten in memory once they are no longer used?
Do overwrite passwords in memory, otherwise they might still exist in memory even after completion of the application and could thus be read by a malicious application.
Are the user ID and password preconfigured or callable through a pull-down menu at the start of the application?
It is better to avoid using any pull-down menus for the user ID/password entry.
This is particularly important for the password.
Can all passwords, IDs and user names be changed?
Non-changeable IDs and passwords often form the starting point for attacks on an application's security.
Starting and Completing Assignments
Use this information to start and complete courses to reduce your current learning assignments.
Starting Assignments
To start a learning assignment, go to Home My Learning Assignments.
Find the course you want to start and click Start Course.
If you cannot start an assignment, click the title of the course.
You see additional actions that you must complete before you can start the course (like enrolling or requesting a schedule).
Completing Assignments
An assignment can be online or instructor-led.
Completing an online assignment is different from completing an instructor-led assignment because you can launch online courses at any time but you must wait for the instructors' schedules to complete instructor-led assignments.
You can start or continue online courses at any time by clicking Start Course or Continue Coursein the My Assignments tile.
When you finish the course, the system automatically records your completion in the History tile.
Instructor-led courses start at a particular time and place and with a particular instructor, so they start and finish on their own schedule.
To reserve a seat for a scheduled course, click the Enroll button for the course.
After your course is over, the instructor or an administrator usually marks the course complete for you.
Recording Completion When it does not Happen Automatically
In some cases the system cannot automatically add the course to your history.
If your course is not added to your history automatically, try recording your own completion in Home Links Record Learning.
If you do not see Record Learning then someone else needs to record the learning for you.
If the completed course does not appear in your history after a few days, contact your supervisor for help.
Your supervisor might be able to mark your course complete in My Employees Supervisor Links Record Learning.

Project Risk Management for Contractors
Purpose
This component provides functions to help you administrate and analyze projects and organizational units according to balance sheet key figures.
Consequently it supports enterprise management and controlling particularly for constructions in progress and plant engineering and construction.
These are often controlled locally, in other words, there are several lines of business, business areas and subsidiaries.
Projects are frequently carried out by several subsidiaries or departments.
Balance sheet key figures from the projects are an important information and controlling instrument for these organization units.
The joint venture represents an artificial level on which project key figures are collected.
The joint ventures are displayed via the joint venture.
The project-oriented enterprise structure aims to structurally represent the organizational units in such a way that it is possible to assign projects to them.
This enables detailed and concise reporting of balance sheet key figures from projects on the different aggregation levels of the enterprise structure.
Implementation Considerations
As prerequisite, you must have installed the component HR Organizational Management.

Reporting of balance sheet key figures is carried out in the Business Information Warehouse (SAP BW).
In the project-oriented enterprise structure is brought together with the transaction data from Joint Venture Accounting (CA-JVA), so that flexible controlling can be carried out for projects and organizational units by key figure.
The Report Painter is available to you for the reporting of balance sheet key figures on project level.
Key Features
The simplified processing of joint venture master data enables you to create and process joint ventures and equity groups (partner shares) quickly and easily.
The structural representation of the joint ventures enables you to assign internal and external joint venture partners, along with their respective equity shares to a joint venture.
The assignment is time-dependent and can change over time.
Projects are linked to the partners involved via the joint venture.
This means you can assign the joint venture to the project or to individual WBS elements.
The distribution of a project between different departments or subsidiaries is reflected in the equity shares of the joint venture partners.
The posting of business transactions takes place in joint venture subledger accounting.
The document split in component CA-JVA is different from the document split in Project Controlling and Risk Management.
If the percentages of equity holdings in the joint venture change, but postings have already been made for the joint venture partners, they must be adjusted to the new equity shares.
To do this, Change Management is available to you.
You can analyze open items for customers, vendors or G/L accounts for each cost center or WBS element.
From the list, you can change individual documents and it is possible to make mass changes to the posted document items.
To be able to analyze project key figures for the individual organizational units, project-oriented enterprise structure functions are available to you to link the organizational structure to the projects.
You establish this link by assigning joint venture partners to organizational units.

Getting Started with Application Development in XS Advanced
SAP HANA applications for SAP HANA XS advanced must include a number of mandatory files that are used for configuration and deployment.
To set up your SAP HANA application as a multi-target application, you need to create the necessary source files and place them in the appropriate folders.
On deployment, the SAP HANA deployment service reads the information contained in the various configuration files and uses it to deploy the various application components to the corresponding targets.
The following high-level rules need to be followed when setting up your SAP HANA application:
Separate all database content (design-time representations of tables, views, procedures, etc.)
Isolate all static content (html, images, other UI related files) in its own folder.
Place language-specific application source files in their own folder.
Since xsodata files must be deployed to a JavaScript or Java run-time, place OData service definitions in the application source folders, for example, javascript/odata/ or java/odata/.
db/
Contains only database artifact, for example: tables, views stored procedures, etc.
web/
Static HTML resources
java/
Java source code and any Odata service definitions
javascript/, js/, or xsjs/
JavaScript source code and any Odata service definitions; this can include either JavaScript or node.js (or both) in sub-folders
The following example include modules for the following areas: database, Web, JavaScript application code, Odata (optional) services, and security (OAuth2 client configuration).
Introduction to Application Development and Deployment (XS Advanced Model)
The SAP HANA Developer Guide for SAP HANAÂ® XS, advanced model, presents a developerâ€™s view of the SAP HANA XS, advanced model, run-time platform.
The SAP HANA Developer Guide guide for SAP HANA XS advanced model explains how to build, deploy, and maintain applications that run in the SAP HANA XS advanced model run time.
The information provided also describes the technical structure of applications that can be deployed to the XS advanced run-time platform.
This guide is aimed at people performing the following developer roles:
Database developers
Often a business/data analyst or database expert, the database developer is concerned with the definition of the data model and schemas that will be used in SAP HANA XS advanced model, the specification and definition of tables, views, primary keys, indexes, partitions and other aspects of the layout and inter-relationship of the data in SAP HANA.
The database developer is also concerned with designing and defining authorization and access control, through the specification of privileges, roles, and users and, in addition, authorization scopes.
Application programmers
The programmer is concerned with building SAP HANA XS advanced model applications: applications that are one part of so-called Multi-Target Applications (MTAs).
Programmers develop the code for the business-logic component, for example, in JavaScript (Node.js or XS JavaScript) or Java.
Client UI developers
The user-interface (UI) client developer designs and creates client applications which bind business logic (from the application developer) to controls, events, and views in the client application user interface.
In this way, data exposed by the database developer can be viewed in the client application's UI.
The code examples included in this document for XS advanced are often syntactically incomplete; they are intended for illustration purposes only.
Recording My Time
There are a number of ways you can record your time in the Payroll Time Sheet, depending on the time recording variant and time recording method assigned to you.
The remainder of this section introduces the time recording variants and time recording methods available in the Payroll Time Sheet for recording your time.
Time Recording Variants
Firstly, there are two options for you to record your time in the time sheet, called time recording variants.
You must use one of these variants.
They are:
Duration-Based Recording
Here you record only the length of time you work each day, in hours and minutes.
Start and end times of the recorded time are not recorded.
Read to learn more about the possible ways to record your duration-based times in the time sheet.
Clock Time-Based Recording
Alternatively, you record only the start and end times of your working time each day.
Read to learn more about the possible ways to record your clock-based times in the time sheet.
Time Recording Methods
Secondly, for your assigned time recording variant, you will actually record your time in the time sheet using one of the following time recording methods:
Positive Time Recording
A method of time recording where employees record all the hours they actually work (their â€˜attendance timeâ€™), in addition to overtime, absences, on-call time and allowances.
With this method, you record all the hours you have actually worked.
For example, you are an hourly-paid employee who records all his or her 'attendance times'.
Negative Time Recording
A method of time recording where employees record only deviations (exceptions) from their planned working time.
Other exceptions such as on-call time, allowances and overtime can also be recorded using this method.
As a negative time recorder, you may also have to record certain other types of attendance time as exceptions if required by your organization, exceptions that must be recorded for documentation purposes or for special payment, such as 'training' or 'administration duties'.
For example, you record two days of external training on a Monday and Tuesday as an exception to your planned working time for that week which is Monday - Friday 09:00 - 17:00.
Overtime Only Recording
A method of time recording where employees record only the time they work that is in addition to their planned working time, plus on-call time and allowances.
You record only your overtime hours.
For example, as a salaried employee, you record only overtime worked in excess of your planned working time.
It may also be the case that as an employee, you are required to record only absences, for example, for reporting/internal administrative purposes.
This time recording method could apply, for example, if you are an executive level employee receiving a set compensation package, where no overtime is recorded or paid.
In this case, you would not record any of your working time in the Payroll Time Sheet.
As an employee recording your time in the time sheet, the Time Recording Profile assigned to you determines the type of time recording you can perform.
You can check your Time Recording Profile in your Employee File, choosing Employment Information Job Information Time Information.
What to Read Next...
We suggest you firstly take a look at the section.
This gives you a first overview of what you can do in the Payroll Time Sheet, depending on your assigned time recording variant and time recording method.
Depending on how your organization has set up the Payroll Time Sheet, you will record your time in one of the six ways shown in this section.
Then, to really get started with the Payroll Time Sheet, dive into the need-to-know information about the time recording variant and method you will use to record your time in the Payroll Time Sheet.
Read either or to find out more.
Finally, the following information is important for everyone recording time in the Payroll Time Sheet, independent of the time recording variant/method used:
and describe making changes to your time sheet data, including changes to past time data.
Read for more information on premium pay for time you have recorded.
Read to see how you can record allowances.

Curricula and Programs
This topic describes the extra features of learning assignments when the assignments are part of a curriculum or program.
Curricula and programs group courses together so that you can reach a learning goal.
For example, a curriculum might group together food washing, storage, and preparation courses to teach safe food handling to kitchen staff.
Although curricula and programs work a little differently, you complete both the same way: you complete the assignments in the group.
The assignments appear in Home My Learning Assignments.
How Programs and Curricula Differ
In general, curricula are designed to be rigid and formal for learning compliance.
Programs are designed to be flexible and easier to use.
Programs can have external content like videos and links.
Unlike curricula, external content in programs does not need to be part of a formal course that you need to find in the Find Learning tile.
Instead, it can just be a link.
In curricula, you often must earn a passing completion status in a prerequsite to take the next course.
Programs do not have formal prerequisites, but they do suggest an order.
You rarely need to find courses to fulfill a program, but you often need to find courses to fulfill curricula.
How to Find Courses that Match your Curriculum Requirements
If you are responsible for finding the courses that meet your curriculum, here are some tips:
To look at your curriculum and decide how you want to complete its assignments, go to Home My Curricula.
To look for courses that help you complete your curriculum, go to Home Available Offerings.
To substitute another course for the one you are currently assigned, go to Home My Learning Assignments,, and then click the title of the assignment.
Click the View Substitute link.
Substitutes are courses that count toward your curriculum instead of the course you have been assigned.
Operate & Troubleshoot
In this section, every service provides operation and troubleshooting information.

FI/CO Intercompany Reconciliation in SAP JVA
Use
SAP FI postings are recorded by company, business area, and functional area.
SAP CO postings occur within a CO area.
Multiple SAP FI companies and business areas may be included in a single CO area.
Also, SAP CO postings are assigned to cost objects, which are themselves assigned to SAP FI companies and business areas.
Usually during posting in an accounting period, expenses are posted from one cost object to another.
For example, when SAP CO allocations are made from a cost center in one SAP FI company or business area to a cost center in a different SAP FI company or business area, this creates a different balance by company, business area, or functional area in SAP CO than in SAP FI.
The FI/CO Reconciliation Ledger process is executed in SAP CO during period end processing to reconcile SAP CO and SAP FI at the company, business area, and functional area levels.
Essentially, this process posts the results of SAP CO postings back into SAP FI at the appropriate level so that SAP FI and SAP CO agree.
Default Handling of FI/CO Reconciliation in SAP JVA
The SAP JVA ledger is organized by company (like the SAP FI company) and joint venture.
Therefore, SAP JVA must maintain agreement with SAP FI at the company and account levels.
Since SAP CO postings are also entered in SAP JVA, the default handling in SAP JVA of intercompany SAP CO postings causes a lack of synchronization at the company level between SAP FI and SAP JVA just as SAP CO and SAP FI are at the end of the period.
With default SAP JVA configuration settings for SAP CO processing, the results of the FI/CO Reconciliation Ledger process are not posted in SAP JVA, because these postings would produce duplicate entries of the original SAP CO postings.
As a result, after the FI/CO Reconciliation Ledger process, SAP JVA is not synchronized with SAP FI at the company level.
Moreover, if BBbyV is active for the SAP JVA company, there will be a balance in SAP JVA for the company in the interventure suspense (I/S) account.
SAP JVA Configuration Settings for FI/CO Intercompany Reconciliation
Two tables in JVA configuration allow you to customize SAP CO processing to address the following requirements:
Ensure period-end synchronization between SAP JVA and SAP FI at the company level
Eliminate the balance on the I/S account created by intercompany SAP CO postings
Enable posting of the results of FI/CO Reconciliation

Text Modules for Data Protection and Privacy Requirements
DPP_INTRO
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Data protection is associated with numerous legal requirements and privacy concerns.
In addition to compliance with general data protection and privacy acts, it is necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries.
SAP provides specific features and functions to support compliance with regard to relevant legal requirements, including data protection.
SAP does not give any advice on whether these features and functions are the best method to support company, industry, regional, or country-specific requirements.
Furthermore, this information should not be taken as advice or a recommendation regarding additional features that would be required in specific IT environments.
Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.
DPP_NOTE
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
SAP does not provide legal advice in any form.
SAP software supports data protection compliance by providing security features and specific data protection-relevant functions, such as simplified blocking and deletion of personal data.
In many cases, compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws will not be covered by a product feature.
Definitions and other terms used in this document are not taken from a particular legal source.
The extent to which data protection is supported by technical means depends on secure system operation.
Network security, security note implementation, adequate logging of system changes, and appropriate usage of the system are the basic technical requirements for compliance with data privacy legislation and other legislation.
DPP_GLOSSARY
Include the following table as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
The following terms are general to SAP products.
Not all terms may be relevant for this SAP product.
Term
Definition
Blocking
A method of restricting access to data for which the primary business purpose has ended.
Consent
The action of the data subject confirming that the usage of his or her personal data shall be allowed for a given purpose.
A consent functionality allows the storage of a consent record in relation to a specific purpose and shows if a data subject has granted, withdrawn, or denied consent.
Data subject
An identified or identifiable natural person.
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
Deletion
Deletion of personal data so that the data is no longer available.
End of business
Date where the business with a data subject ends, for example, the order is completed, the subscription is canceled, or the last bill is settled.
End of purpose (EoP)
End of purpose and start of blocking period.
The point in time when the primary processing purpose ends, for example, a contract is fulfilled.
End of purpose (EoP) check
A method of identifying the point in time for a data set when the processing of personal data is no longer required for the primary business purpose.
After the EoP has been reached, the data is blocked and can only be accessed by users with special authorization, for example, tax auditors.
Personal data
Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (a data subject).
Purpose
The information that specifies the reason and the goal for the processing of a specific set of personal data.
As a rule, the purpose references the relevant legal basis for the processing of personal data.
Residence period
The period of time between the end of business and the end of purpose (EoP) for a data set during which the data remains in the database and can be used in case of subsequent processes related to the original purpose.
At the end of the longest configured residence period, the data is blocked or deleted.
The residence period is part of the overall retention period.
Retention period
The period of time between the end of the last business activity involving a specific object (for example, a business partner) and the deletion of the corresponding data, subject to applicable laws.
The retention period is a combination of the residence period and the blocking period.
Sensitive personal data
A category of personal data that usually includes the following type of information:
Special categories of personal data, such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or sex life or sexual orientation.
Personal data subject to professional secrecy
Personal data relating to criminal or administrative offenses
Personal data concerning insurances and bank or credit card accounts
Where-used check (WUC)
A process designed to ensure data integrity in the case of potential blocking of business partner data.
An application's where-used check (WUC) determines if there is any dependent data for a certain business partner in the database.
If dependent data exists, this means the data is still required for business activities.
Therefore, the blocking of business partners referenced in the data is prevented.
The following terms are general to SAP products.
Not all terms may be relevant for this SAP product.
DPP_USERCONSENT
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
SAP applications ask for consent of the data subject before collecting any personal data.
In some cases, the data subject may also be the user.
This SAP product provides functionality that allows data subjects to give and withdraw consent to collect and process their personal data.
SAP assumes that the user, for example, an SAP customer collecting data, has consent from its data subject (a natural person such as a customer, contact, or account) to collect or transfer data to the solution.
DPP_READACCESS
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Read access logging (RAL) is used to monitor and log read access to sensitive data.
Data may be categorized as sensitive by law, by external company policy, or by internal company policy.
Read access logging enables you to answer questions about who accessed particular data within a specified time frame.
Here are some examples of such questions:
Who accessed the data of a given business entity, for example a bank account?
Who accessed personal data, for example of a business partner?
Which employee accessed personal information, for example religion?
Which accounts or business partners were accessed by which users?
From a technical point of view, this means that all remote APIs and UI infrastructures (that access the data) must be enabled for logging.
DPP_DELETEPERSDATA
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Simplified Blocking and Deletion
When considering compliance with data protection regulations, it is also necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries.
A typical potential scenario in certain countries is that personal data shall be deleted after the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for the processing of personal data has ended, but only as long as no other retention periods are defined in legislation, for example, retention periods for financial documents.
Legal requirements in certain scenarios or countries also often require blocking of data in cases where the specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes for the processing of this data have ended, however, the data still has to be retained in the database due to other legally mandated retention periods.
In some scenarios, personal data also includes referenced data.
Therefore, the challenge for deletion and blocking is first to handle referenced data and finally other data, such as business partner data.
Deletion of Personal Data
The processing of personal data is subject to applicable laws related to the deletion of this data when the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for processing this personal data has expired.
If there is no longer a legitimate purpose that requires the retention and use of personal data, it must be deleted.
When deleting data in a data set, all referenced objects related to that data set must be deleted as well.
Industry-specific legislation in different countries also needs to be taken into consideration in addition to general data protection laws.
After the expiration of the longest retention period, the data must be deleted.
DPP_CHANGELOG
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Personal data is subject to frequent changes.
Therefore, for review purposes or as a result of legal regulations, it may be necessary to track the changes made to this data.
When these changes are logged, you should be able to check which employee made which change, the date and time, the previous value, and the current value, depending on the configuration.
It is also possible to analyze errors in this way.
ABAP Text Modules for Data Protection and Privacy Requirements
Generic Fields
You need to make sure that no personal data enters the system in an uncontrolled or non-purpose related way, for example, in free-text fields, through APIs, or customer extensions.
Note that these are not subject to the read access logging (RAL) example configuration.
Use
In read access logging (RAL), you can configure which read-access information to log and under which conditions.
SAP delivers sample configurations for applications.
The application component scenario logs data to describe business processes.
Read access logging is currently available in, but not limited to the following channels:
Remote Function Calls (sRFC, aRFC, tRFC, qRFC, bgFRC)
Dynpro (dynpro fields, ALV Grid, ABAP List, F4)
Web Dynpro

Information Retrieval
Data subjects have the right to receive information regarding their personal data that is being processed.
The information retrieval feature supports you in complying with the relevant legal requirements for data protection by allowing you to search for and retrieve all personal data for a specified data subject.
The search results are displayed in a comprehensive and structured list containing all personal data of the data subject specified, organized according to the purpose for which the data was collected and processed.
Deletion of personal data
To enable even complex scenarios, SAP simplifies existing deletion functionalities to cover data objects that are personal data by default.
For this purpose, SAP uses SAP Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) to help you set up a compliant information lifecycle management process in an efficient and flexible manner.
The functions that support the simplified blocking and deletion of personal data are not delivered in one large implementation, but in several waves.
Scenarios or products that are not specified in SAP Note (central Business Partner) and SAP Note <locked-ref> (ERP Customer and Vendor) are not yet subject to simplified blocking and deletion.
Nevertheless, it is also possible to destroy personal data for these scenarios or products.
In these cases, you have to use an existing archival or deletion functionality or implement individual retention management of relevant business data throughout its entire lifecycle.
The ILM component supports the entire software lifecycle including storage, retention, blocking, and deletion of data.
This SAP product uses SAP ILM to support the deletion of personal data as described in the following sections:
SAP delivers a where-used check (WUC) for the product.
All applications register either an EoP check in the Customizing settings for the blocking and deletion of application data (for example, the customer and vendor master or the business partner) or a WUC.
End of Purpose Check (EoP check)
An end of purpose (EoP) check determines whether data is still relevant for business activities based on the retention period defined for the data.
The retention period is part of the overall lifecycle of personal data which consists of the following phases:
Business activity:
The relevant data is used in ongoing business, for example contract creation, delivery or payment.
Residence period:
The relevant data remains in the database and can be used in case of subsequent processes related to the original purpose, for example reporting obligations.
Blocking period:
The relevant data needs to be retained for legal reasons.
During the blocking period, business users of SAP applications are prevented from displaying and using this data; it can only be processed in case of mandatory legal provisions.
Deletion:
The data is deleted and no longer exists in the database.
Blocking of data can impact system behavior in the following ways:
Display:
The system does not display blocked data.
Change:
It is not possible to change a business object that contains blocked data.
Create:
It is not possible to create a business object that contains blocked data
Copy/Follow-Up:
It is not possible to copy a business object or perform follow-up activities for a business object that contains blocked data.
Search:
It is not possible to search for blocked data or to search for a business object using blocked data in the search criteria.
It is possible to display blocked data if a user has special authorization; however, it is still not possible to create, change, copy, or perform follow-up activities on blocked data.
A where-used check is a simple check to ensure data integrity in case of potential blocking.
The WUC for this product checks whether any dependent data for a customer, vendor, or central business partner (cBP) exists in the respective table.
If dependent data exists, that is, if the data is still required for business activities, the system does not block that specific customer, vendor, or cBP.
If you still want to block the data, the dependent data must be deleted by using the existing archival and deletion tools or by using another customer-specific solution.
Change Log
Setting Up Change Logs
This SAP product processes the personal data of business partners that are involved in change requests and activities.
If any changes are made regarding the business partner, the system logs the following information about personal data per change request and activity:
The user who changed data
The date and time of the change
The change type (update, insert, deletion, single field documentation)
The identifying keys and their values from the data records
The heading name for the attribute that has been changed
You can define the fields to be logged under Display Change Document Objects (transaction ).
You can use the authorization object to to control the change logging for change requests and activities.
Displaying Change Logs in SAP product
In the Worklist of SAP product, you can access a change log for each change request and activity.
Change logs can only be displayed if the user is assigned the authorization role <locked-ref>.
Under Evaluate New Audit Trail Enhancement Mode (transaction ), you can see all changes that have been processed for the change document objects in SAP product, (activity) and <locked-ref> (change request).

Learning Items, Scheduled Offerings, Curricula, and Programs
A learning item is similar to a math course you find in a university course catalog: the university tracks your progress in the course and grades you when you complete your exams.
In, your learning administrator tracks your completion in a learning item (for example, workplace safety).
A scheduled offering is similar to one scheduled math course at a university: it can be offered on Mondays at 10 AM and on Wednesdays at 6 PM.
You can attend either one and earn credit.
In, your learning administrator wants to know which of the scheduled workplace safety courses you attended.
A curriculum is similar to a degree in the university: if you earn your degree in mathematics, you have taken a number of required math courses and some elective courses.
In, a curriculum is smaller than a university degree, but it has similar rules and requirements, and you cannot complete the curriculum until you have completed your required courses.
For example, the workplace safety course can be part of a larger Safety and Security Basics curriculum that covers workplace safety, computer security, building security, and travel safety.
A program is like a curriculum except that it accounts for its hours differently and uses different rules to determine which courses you take.
Programs are often informal groups of learning items.

User Exit for Intercompany Lines in SAP FI Documents
Use
When you post an SAP FI document in an SAP Joint Venture Accounting (JVA) company, the SAP JVA integration manager creates the corresponding SAP JVA document.
The SAP JVA integration manager determines the joint venture information needed to formulate the SAP JVA document.
It derives the joint venture, the equity group, and the recovery indicator (RI) for each line in the SAP FI document.
In addition, the integration manager determines whether or not each SAP FI line should be the basis for splitting the other lines in the SAP JVA version document, or whether the SAP FI line should itself be split in the SAP JVA document.
The integration manager handles splitting differently, depending on whether the line belongs to a clearing or a non-clearing document, and depending on what joint venture information is available for the line.
SAP JVA Handling with User Exit
The enhancement JVA-IM-1 with function module exit EXIT_SAPLGJVI_001 for intercompany lines enables you to handle intercompany lines differently, than the standard handling, when assigning recovery indicators (RIs) and determining splitting.
This exit is only called when SAP JVA is active for the SAP FI company.
If an SAP FI document contains intercompany lines, SAP JVA calls this exit to determine the handling of those lines.
The user exit can determine the following, when formulating the SAP JVA line for an SAP FI intercompany line:
RI to be assigned to the line
Whether the line should be the basis for splitting other lines in the document, or if the line itself should be split
To enable the SAP JVA integration manager to determine these two issues, the user exit uses information on the intercompany lines taken from a table (Refer to Table 1).
An ABAP program can provide the necessary RI and splitting information for intercompany lines.
User Exit Table
To determine handling for intercompany lines, the user exit refers to a table with document information.
This table contains one line for each company in the intercompany document, as shown in the following example:
Table 1
Field
Contents
AWTYP
Type of the document (usually RFBU )
AWREF
Reference document number (This field will be empty)
AWORG
Reference organizational unit (This field will be empty)
BUKRS
Company code
BELNR
Preliminary document number
GJAHR
Fiscal year
APPL
Application (SAP FI, SAP CO, SAP MM, SAP SD)
CLEAR
Flag the document if it is a clearing document
CLEAR_LN
Number of clearing lines for this company (A clearing document usually has clearing lines only in a single company.
VENDOR
Number of vendor lines for the company
CUSTOM
Number of customer lines for the company
GLACCT
Number of general ledger account lines for the company
EXCHGE
Number of exchange difference lines for the company
TAX
Number of tax lines for the company
ASSET
Number of asset lines for the company
DISCNT
Number of discount lines for the company
INTCOM
Number of intercompany lines for the company (This should always be 1 â€“ If it is greater than 1, the user exit is not called)
SPLIT
Value set to one of the following by the user-created program:
BLANK Standard handling of split determination.
The intercompany line is taken as the basis for splitting other lines in the SAP JVA document
The intercompany line is split on the bases of the joint venture information available from other lines in the document
RECID
Value for RI supplied by the user exit program
SAP JVA Integration Manager Handling of User Exit Table Entries
The RI entered in the table field RECID by the user exit program is set on the intercompany line for the company in the document.
When splitting the intercompany line, the integration manager checks the split flag in the table, which should be set by the user exit program.
If there is no value in the SPLIT field, the SAP JVA integration manager applies default splitting to the intercompany line.
If the value in the SPLIT field is 1, no splitting takes place.
If joint venture information is available on the intercompany line, then the line is the basis for splitting other lines in the SAP JVA document.
If no joint venture information is provided on the intercompany line, the corporate joint venture information for the company is assigned to the line.
If the value in the SPLIT field is 2, the document is a clearing document, and open items for the company are selected.
The intercompany line is split, according to the joint venture information on the open items.
If there are no open items for the company, the value in the SPLIT field is changed to 1 and no split takes place, because there is no basis available.
Creating the User Exit Program
The first step in creating a user exit program for handling intercompany lines in SAP JVA documents is to create a user project and copy the delivered SAP JVA objects into the project.
Menu Path
On the SAP Easy Access menu, choose Tools ABAP Workbench Utilities Enhancements Project management.
The Project Management of SAP Enhancements screen appears.
You must create an ABAP program to fill the RECID and SPLIT fields of the SAP JVA intercompany user exit table.

Suspension of JVA Projects, Partners, and Equity Groups
Purpose
If a project, partner, or equity group is suspended, cutback postings are not executed.
When you remove the project, partner, or equity group from suspense, cutback processes all expenses incurred during suspense.
Suspended partners do not receive an invoice.
When partners are removed from suspense, they receive an invoice that includes expenses for the complete period of suspense.
You cannot place equity groups in suspense if there are any outstanding current or future postings to the equity group.
You can place work breakdown structure (WBS) elements in suspense if there are outstanding current or future postings other than cash calls.
You cannot place WBS elements in suspense if current or future cash calls have been posted for the WBS element.

Data Provider
Third-party company collecting data
A third-party company collecting data from different data origins and possibly executing data cleansing and enrichment services.
For example, Dun & Bradstreet is a data provider.
External Requests Work Area
The external request work area is for organizations that require that you complete an electronic form as part of an approval process for external training: training that is outside of your organization.
For example, United States Federal customers use a form called "SF-182" to request external training.
provides a work area for external requests at Home Links External Requests..
In the work area, you can:
Complete and submit an online form requesting external courses
View forms that have been sent to you for approval, and then approve or deny the request with a reason
External Request (SF-182) Workflow
The phrase "External Request" can be confusing.
The workflow uses the phrase even after a request has been approved.
A request can have multiple phases, including approved.
Completing an External Request Form
Go to Home Links External Requests.
To open a blank form, click New Request.
To reuse a form, changing only the form fields that need to change, click Copy Request next to the form you want to copy.
After you complete the form, follow the workflow wizard to send the form for approval.
If you need help completing the form, click the Instructions link to open instructions on your particular form.
Approving or Denying Requests
When you have pending approval requests, you see an alert:
Home My Learning Assignments You have pending approval requests.
You can either click the alert or click Home Links Approvals to open the approvals work area.
You use the same approvals work area whether you are approving an external request, approving the verification of an external request, or approving some other kind of request, such as internal training.
In the approvals work area, go to Training External Training and then follow the workflow wizard to approve or deny the request.
Your organization might have multiple steps in the workflow, but at the end of the process, the request appears in the user's assignments list and the user's external request work area.
Identifying Upcoming External Training
To identify upcoming external training events, go to Home My Assignments Filter, and then select External Requests from the course types list.
Verifying an External Request
After you attend an event, you verify that you attended it.
To verify your attendance, go to Home Links External Requests.
Find the request that corresponds to your event and click Verify.
Follow the workflow wizard to complete verification.
After you verify your attendance, the event appears in your history.
In many cases, you can verify your attendance by yourself.
In some cases, an administrator must verify your attendance.

Information Retrieval
Data subjects have the right to receive information regarding their personal data that is being processed.
The information retrieval feature supports you in complying with the relevant legal requirements for data protection by allowing you to search for and retrieve all personal data for a specified data subject.
The search results are displayed in a comprehensive and structured list containing all personal data of the data subject specified, organized according to the purpose for which the data was collected and processed.
Deletion of personal data
To enable even complex scenarios, SAP simplifies existing deletion functionalities to cover data objects that are personal data by default.
For this purpose, SAP uses SAP Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) to help you set up a compliant information lifecycle management process in an efficient and flexible manner.
The functions that support the simplified blocking and deletion of personal data are not delivered in one large implementation, but in several waves.
Scenarios or products that are not specified in SAP Note (central Business Partner) and SAP Note <locked-ref> (ERP Customer and Vendor) are not yet subject to simplified blocking and deletion.
Nevertheless, it is also possible to destroy personal data for these scenarios or products.
In these cases, you have to use an existing archival or deletion functionality or implement individual retention management of relevant business data throughout its entire lifecycle.
The ILM component supports the entire software lifecycle including storage, retention, blocking, and deletion of data.
End of Purpose Check (EoP check)
An end of purpose (EoP) check determines whether data is still relevant for business activities based on the retention period defined for the data.
The retention period is part of the overall lifecycle of personal data, which consists of the following phases:
Business activity:
The relevant data is used in ongoing business, for example contract creation, delivery or payment.
Residence period:
The relevant data remains in the database and can be used in case of subsequent processes related to the original purpose, for example reporting obligations.
Blocking period:
The relevant data needs to be retained for legal reasons.
During the blocking period, business users of SAP applications are prevented from displaying and using this data.
It can only be processed in case of mandatory legal provisions.
Deletion:
The data is deleted and no longer exists in the database.
Blocking of data can impact system behavior in the following ways:
Display:
The system does not display blocked data.
Change:
It is not possible to change a business object that contains blocked data.
Create:
It is not possible to create a business object that contains blocked data
Copy/follow-up:
It is not possible to copy a business object or perform follow-up activities for a business object that contains blocked data.
Search:
It is not possible to search for blocked data or to search for a business object using blocked data in the search criteria.
It is possible to display blocked data if a user has special authorization; however, it is still not possible to create, change, copy, or perform follow-up activities on blocked data.
Before blocking or deleting of personal data, you must define the residence time and retention periods in SAP Information Lifecycle Management (ILM) for the corresponding ILM objects.
You can choose whether data deletion is required for data stored in archive files or data stored in the database, depending on the type of deletion functionality available.
For an end of purpose check regarding business partner master data complete the following steps:
Define the required residence and retention policies for the business partner ILM objects.
Run the corresponding transaction to enable the end-of-purpose check function for business partners.
After EoP the master data is blocked and the required retention information is stored.
Business users can request unblocking of blocked business partner master data.
Users that have the necessary authorizations can unblock the data.
You can delete data using the transaction ILM_DESTRUCTION for the ILM objects of application, component, scenario.
Change Log
Displaying Change Logs in SAP product
In the Worklist of SAP product, you can access a change log for each change request and activity.
Change logs can only be displayed if the user is assigned the authorization role <locked-ref>.
Under Evaluate New Audit Trail Enhancement Mode (transaction ), you can see all changes that have been processed for the change document objects in SAP product, (activity) and <locked-ref> (change request).

Working with Competency Assessments
Use this information to understand how competency assessments relate to learning.
A competency assessment is an employee performance tool.
It asks other employees to evaluate how competent you are in areas that matter to your organization.
Competency assessments start in employee performance, but they matter to because your courses can help you achieve high scores in your competency assessments.
In fact, you can receive an automatic competency assessment when you complete a course that addresses one of your competencies.
For example, if you earn credit for a writing course, the system can update a "written communication" competency.
Users of Plateau legacy products cannot use competency assessments.

Joint Venture Accounting (JVA) Objects
Definition
The primary SAP JVA objects are described in the following table.
Object name
Description
Joint Operating Agreement (JOA)
A JOA is a formal agreement that specifies the conditions for a joint operation.
This covers the interests of the partners and their properties, as well as overheads and penalties.
Joint Venture
This is an association of two or more partners, formed to share a ventureâ€™s risks, costs, and revenues.
Each partnerâ€™s share is proportional to their undivided interest in the venture.
Equity Type
The JOA has different development stages, such as engineering and design, construction, and production.
Different partners participate at each stage.
JVA manages the different stages by using equity types.
An equity type explains a particular association of partners.
This definition may be related to time, phase or purpose and is linked with a specific equity group.
Equity Group
An equity group represents an association of venture partners and their interests.
An equity group may consist of all or some of the venture partners.
Joint Venture Partner
This is a partner mentioned in the JOA with an undivided interest in a venture.
One partner, called the operator, manages the operation.
The remaining non-operating partners share expenses and revenues.
Recovery and Billing Indicators
You assign a recovery indicator to a cost object to indicate whether or not expenses, posted using the cost object, are billable to JVA partners.
You assign billable costs to the appropriate partners.
Non-billable expenses are assigned to the operator.
Billing indicators are assigned to billable postings and identify the type of posting involved, including cash call, normal expenditure, and audit adjustment.
Use
The JOA specifies the relationship between partners, joint ventures, and rules for cost calculations.
Joint ventures, equity types, and equity groups are assigned to a JOA.
Joint venture partners are assigned to equity groups.
A joint venture can belong to only one JOA.
However, multiple ventures can belong to the same JOA.
You can assign multiple equity groups to one JOA, and you can assign the same equity group to multiple joint ventures.
Structure
The following diagram shows the relationship between SAP JVA objects.
SAP JVA Business Object Structure
Common SAP JVA activities include setting up and maintaining JVA objects.
Generic Text Modules for DPP Requirements
DPP_INTRO
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Data protection is associated with numerous legal requirements and privacy concerns.
In addition to compliance with general data protection and privacy acts, it is necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries.
SAP provides specific features and functions to support compliance with regard to relevant legal requirements, including data protection.
SAP does not give any advice on whether these features and functions are the best method to support company, industry, regional, or country-specific requirements.
Furthermore, this information should not be taken as advice or a recommendation regarding additional features that would be required in specific IT environments.
Decisions related to data protection must be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration the given system landscape and the applicable legal requirements.
DPP_NOTE
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
SAP does not provide legal advice in any form.
SAP software supports data protection compliance by providing security features and specific data protection-relevant functions, such as simplified blocking and deletion of personal data.
In many cases, compliance with applicable data protection and privacy laws will not be covered by a product feature.
Definitions and other terms used in this document are not taken from a particular legal source.
The extent to which data protection is supported by technical means depends on secure system operation.
Network security, security note implementation, adequate logging of system changes, and appropriate usage of the system are the basic technical requirements for compliance with data privacy legislation and other legislation.
DPP_GLOSSARY
Include the following table as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
The following terms are general to SAP products.
Not all terms may be relevant for this SAP product.
Term
Definition
Blocking
A method of restricting access to data for which the primary business purpose has ended.
Business Purpose
The legal, contractual, or in other form justified reason for the processing of personal data to complete an end-to-end business process.
The personal data used to complete the process is predefined in a purpose, which is defined by the data controller.
The process must be defined before the personal data required to fulfill the purpose can be determined.
Consent
The action of the data subject confirming that the usage of his or her personal data shall be allowed for a given purpose.
A consent functionality allows the storage of a consent record in relation to a specific purpose and shows if a data subject has granted, withdrawn, or denied consent.
Data Subject
Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject").
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
Deletion
Deletion of personal data so that the data is no longer available.
End of business
Defines the end of active business and the start of residence time and retention period.
End of Purpose (EoP)
The point in time when the processing of a set of personal data is no longer required for the primary business purpose, for example, when a contract is fulfilled.
After the EoP has been reached, the data is blocked and can only be accessed by users with special authorizations (for example, tax auditors).
End of Purpose (EoP) check
A method of identifying the point in time for a data set when the processing of personal data is no longer required for the primary business purpose.
After the EoP has been reached, the data is blocked and can only be accessed by users with special authorization, for example, tax auditors.
Personal Data
Any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("data subject").
An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier, or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.
Purpose
The information that specifies the reason and the goal for the processing of a specific set of personal data.
As a rule, the purpose references the relevant legal basis for the processing of personal data.
Residence Period
The period of time between the end of business and the end of purpose (EoP) for a data set during which the data remains in the database and can be used in case of subsequent processes related to the original purpose.
At the end of the longest configured residence period, the data is blocked or deleted.
The residence period is part of the overall retention period.
Retention Period
The period of time between the end of the last business activity involving a specific object (for example, a business partner) and the deletion of the corresponding data, subject to applicable laws.
The retention period is a combination of the residence period and the blocking period.
Sensitive Personal Data
A category of personal data that usually includes the following type of information:
Special categories of personal data, such as data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, trade union membership, genetic data, biometric data, data concerning health or sex life or sexual orientation.
Personal data subject to professional secrecy
Personal data relating to criminal or administrative offenses
Personal data concerning insurances and bank or credit card accounts
Technical and Organizational Measures (TOM)
Some basic requirements that support data protection and privacy are often referred to as technical and organizational measures (TOM).
The following topics are related to data protection and privacy and require appropriate TOMs, for example:
Access control Authentication features
Authorizations Authorization concept
Read access logging
Transmission control/communication security
Input control/change logging
Availability control
Separation by purpose Subject to the organizational model implemented and must be applied as part of the authorization concept.
The following terms are general to SAP products.
Not all terms may be relevant for this SAP product.
DPP_USERCONSENT
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Any personal data collected or processed must be linked to a specific, pre-defined purpose, such as the fulfilment of a contract or legal obligation.
If there is no other legal basis for the lawful processing of personal data or - in some cases - if the data is to be sent to a third party, you must obtain consent from the data subject to use their personal data.
SAP applications ask for consent of the data subject before collecting any personal data.
In some cases, the data subject may also be the user.
This SAP product provides functionality that allows data subjects to give and withdraw consent to collect and process their personal data.
SAP assumes that the user, for example, an SAP customer collecting data, has consent from its data subject (a natural person such as a customer, contact, or account) to collect or transfer data to the solution.
DPP_READACCESS
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Read access to personal data is partially based on legislation, and it is subject to logging functionality.
Read access logging (RAL) is used to monitor and log read access to sensitive data.
Data may be categorized as sensitive by law, by external company policy, or by internal company policy.
Read access logging enables you to answer questions about who accessed particular data within a specified time frame.
Here are some examples of such questions:
Who accessed the data of a given business entity, for example a bank account?
Who accessed personal data, for example of a business partner?
Which employee accessed personal information, for example religion?
Which accounts or business partners were accessed by which users?
From a technical point of view, this means that all remote APIs and UI infrastructures (that access the data) must be enabled for logging.
DPP_DELETEPERSDATA
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Simplified Blocking and Deletion
When considering compliance with data protection regulations, it is also necessary to consider compliance with industry-specific legislation in different countries.
A typical potential scenario in certain countries is that personal data shall be deleted after the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for the processing of personal data has ended, but only as long as no other retention periods are defined in legislation, for example, retention periods for financial documents.
Legal requirements in certain scenarios or countries also often require blocking of data in cases where the specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes for the processing of this data have ended, however, the data still has to be retained in the database due to other legally mandated retention periods.
In some scenarios, personal data also includes referenced data.
Therefore, the challenge for deletion and blocking is first to handle referenced data and finally other data, such as business partner data.
Deletion of Personal Data
The processing of personal data is subject to applicable laws related to the deletion of this data when the specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose for processing this personal data has expired.
If there is no longer a legitimate purpose that requires the retention and use of personal data, it must be deleted.
When deleting data in a data set, all referenced objects related to that data set must be deleted as well.
Industry-specific legislation in different countries also needs to be taken into consideration in addition to general data protection laws.
After the expiration of the longest retention period, the data must be deleted.
This SAP product might process data (personal data) that is subject to the data protection laws applicable in specific countries.
DPP_CHANGELOG
Include the following standard text as referable text fragment via <locked-ref>.
Creation and change of personal data need to be documented.
Therefore, for review purposes or as a result of legal regulations, it may be necessary to track the changes made to this data.
When these changes are logged, you should be able to check which employee made which change, the date and time, the previous value, and the current value, depending on the configuration.
It is also possible to analyze errors in this way.
SAP Virus Scan Interface
Description
Any kind of external data such as office documents, images, binaries are considered insecure unless they are scanned for malicious and/or suspicious code.
Virus scanning should be performed every time potentially polluted data is imported through input channels into the SAP system.
Possible input channels are:
File upload from front end PC's or file system on the application server
File upload using the Internet
Document exchange with RFC, XML, XI
Since SAP-managed databases are central distribution points, it is very dangerous to store malformed or otherwise dangerous data in them as this data might spread very quickly across the network.
Applications that are transferring files to or from SAP-managed databases must ensure that the data is not vulnerable to any known threats.
What Do I Get from the Platform?
SAP has developed an interface especially for this purpose.
It is intended to provide virus scanning services for the application developers as transparently as possible.
The interface is known as the Virus Scan Interface (NW-VSI) and is available for both AS ABAP and AS Java.
You can use the virus scan interface to include external virus scanners in the SAP system to increase the security of your system.
A third-party product (external anti-virus solution) is required to perform the actual virus scan.
The certifiable interface called "NW-VSI" ( Virus Scan Interface) needs to be activated.
This means that you can use a high-performance integration solution to scan files or documents that are processed by applications for viruses.
This applies both for applications delivered by SAP and for customer developments, for example, during data transfers across networks or when documents are exchanged using interfaces.
The architecture of the Virus Scan Interface allows you to combine different products, systems, and platforms to scan your applications for viruses.
This is possible since SAP provides a certified interface for the virus scan products of other vendors.
The partners' virus scan engines can, for example, have completely different architectures.
However, by integrating an adapter using a proprietary connection, any partner can connect any existing virus scan product to the virus scan interface.
On the SAP side, different VSILIB layers are used to include the ABAP and Java worlds, and to deal with platform dependencies (of operating systems and processors, that is, 32 or 64 bit) in the integration of the virus scan interface.
For more information about the VSI on AS Java, see Java-Specific Configuration in the VSI documentation.
Elements of the Virus Scan Interface
The graphic below clarifies the layer structure of the SAP Virus Scan Interface (SAP VSI API) and shows which parts are delivered by SAP, and which by the relevant partners.
Software Layers of the Virus Scan Interface
The SAP Virus Scan Interface (SAP VSI API):
Is accessed by partner products directly with the scan engine or indirectly using a separate virus scan adapter.
Contains the functions required to configure and to initialize the scan engine.
Provides the parameters and data for every virus scan.
Processes the check result.
ABAP or Java application programs start virus scans with dedicated classes and methods of the SAP virus scan interface, which, in turn, call a virus scan server or the AS Java directly using RFC.
What Do I Need to Do?
a) Virus Scan Profiles
Different applications have different requirements for virus scanning.
For example, an HR application dealing with external recruiting forms wants high security scanning whereas performance is not a critical aspect.
On the other hand, a CRM application dealing with mostly internal documents wants less scanning effort and better performance.
Virus scan profiles are used to allow for application-specific configuration of virus scanning.
Application programs use virus scan profiles to check data for viruses.
You can also define which scanner group/groups are to be used to check a document.
You can also use a virus scan profile to assign configuration parameters for the virus scanner.
If you check for viruses with this virus scan profile, the virus scanner receives the parameters.
Virus scan profiles can point to other profiles (reference mechanism).
SAP delivers profiles for its applications, pointing all to the "default profile".
By creating one single virus scan profile and flagging it as the "default profile", customers can use this profile for all SAP applications without separate configuration.
The system administrator can use the profile to activate or deactivate the virus scan for each component.
By default, a virus scan profile is provided for each SAP application that integrates a virus scan.
For more information, see Defining Virus Scan Profiles.
You should define your own virus scan profile if your application uploads external documents (such as DOC, XLS, PDF, and so on) into the SAP system and stores them for further processing or delivery.
Examples of applications of this type are document upload in the Knowledge Warehouse or the eRecruiting application in HR, which uploads application forms.
You should not define your own virus scan profile if your application uploads data that is parsed by your own application.
For example, an application that parses a XML file itself for configuration purposes.
b) Configuring and Testing the Virus Scan Provider
The virus scan provider is the service of the AS Java that makes the virus scanning interface available to the SAP applications of the Engine.
You can use either a virus scan adapter or a virus scan server as a virus scan provider.
The virus scan server is an alternative if you cannot use the better-performing virus scan adapter.
The configuration of the virus scan provider service is stored in the Configuration Manager of the AS Java.
You can use the Visual Administrator for graphical administration.
For detailed information, see Setting Up Virus Scan Providers.
In order to check that your configured virus scan provider is functioning correctly, use the procedure described in Testing the Installation of the Virus Scan Provider.
See also section "d) Testing Your Application" below.
c) Developing VSI-Aware Applications
The AS Java service "Virus Scan Provider" ( tc/sec/vsi/service ) provides the interface "Virus Scan Interface".
The Java interface "Virus Scan Interface" ( tc/sec/vsi/interface ) provides the scan API for applications within the AS Java.
The virus scanning is performed using an instance object previously obtained from the virus scan provider service.
An application may choose to either scan byte array or scan file on the disk.
The scan result is reported through an exception handling mechanism.
For a detailed description of the API, see Interfaces and Classes of the Virus Scan Provider API.
For more information, see also the JavaDocs for the relevant interfaces and classes.
You can find the JavaDocs at www.sdn.sap.com/irj/sdn/javadocs.
In order to integrate virus scanning into your own application you need to set a reference in your configuration file to tc/sec/vsi/interface (see below).
You must not reference the AS Java service directly.
The interfaces are delivered within the Studio.
Alternatively, you can use the JAR file " tc_sec_vsi_interface.jar " in your engine folder (see below).
d) Testing Your Application
A test application is delivered within each AS Java.
Use the URL path http://<hostname>:<port>/vscantest.
You can start the test application that belongs to the 'Virus Scan Provider'.
This contains two servlets: one for the overview of the configured objects and a servlet for testing the scan API, which operates in the same way as the test application using the (ABAP) Transaction 'VSCANTEST'.
Example Code
For example coding, see Example Program for the Virus Scan Provider.
