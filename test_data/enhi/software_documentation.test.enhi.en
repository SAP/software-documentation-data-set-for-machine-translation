The XS Advanced Programming Model
Writing applications for deployment to SAP HANA XS advanced.
SAP HANA Extended Application Services advanced model (XS advanced) adds an application platform to the SAP HANA in-memory database.
In the Cloud, this platform is provided by Cloud Foundry.
An SAP-developed run-time environment is bundled with SAP HANA on-premise which provides a compatible platform that enables applications to be deployed to both worlds: the Cloud and on-premise.
XS advanced is optimized for simple deployment and the operation of business applications that need to be deployed in both worlds.
For this reason, the XS advanced programming model fully embraces the Cloud Foundry model and leverages its concepts and technologies.
In areas where Cloud Foundry as an intentionally generic platform for distributed Web applications does not address relevant topics or offers choice, the XS advanced programming model provides guidance that is in line with the general Cloud programming model.
In this section, you can find information about the following topics:
Cloud Foundry Concepts
System Architecture
Run-Time Platform
Authentication and Authorization
Component Model
Client User Interface
OData Services
SAP HANA Database
Includes information about the Service Broker, HDI containers, the HDI deployer, the SAP HANA Instance Broker, and database synonyms, as well as Core Data Services
Cloud Foundry Concepts
The Cloud Foundry platform runs applications; these applications belong to spaces, which belong in turn to organizations.
In the context of an organization, the platform users can be assigned special permissions in the different spaces.
For example, administrators and developers need permissions to deploy and start applications.
Spaces can be used to provide a secure and isolated environment for the development teams working on different projects.
Applications can use various runtime services, for example, in XS advanced: database services, the User Account and Authentication service (UAA), or a scheduler service.
Each service can be offered in different configurations called service plans, which have different features and characteristics.
Before a service can be used by an application, it is necessary to create a service instance to which the application must be bound.
For each type of service there is a service broker; the service broker executes the actions required to create and delete service instances and bind application to services.
The UAA service broker, for example, implements the API for managing UAA service instances.
What a service instance means technically may differ between services and service plans.
A service instance can be just a configuration for a shared implementation and a separate login and data area on a shared server.
In certain other cases, each service instance can have its own server.
Basic Cloud Foundry Concepts
Applications are deployed to the target platform by using the <locked-ref> operation of the platform API.
For this reason, in Cloud Foundry parlance, applications are pushed to the platform.
Pushing an application works as follows:
First the application files are uploaded to the platform.
Next, programs called buildpacks are executed to create archives that create the self-contained and ready-to-run executable applications.
Some of the most typical activities executed by buildpacks are: downloading any required libraries and other dependencies, and configuring the application.
Different buildpacks exist for the different target run-time environments such as Java or JavaScript/Node.js.
Applications are started as separate processes.
At run time, the applications need the connection information for the services instances to which they are bound.
The applications obtain this information from process-specific environment variables, which are resolved by the platform in a process known as service wiring.
Bindings can only be created between applications and service instances in the same space.
For scale-out scenarios, the platform can be instructed to start multiple instances of an application (several processes).
XS advanced on-premise also implements the concepts of spaces, applications, services, buildpacks and droplets.
Like Cloud Foundry applications, XS advanced applications are units that can be pushed, started, stopped, and bound to services.
You can display a list of all the applications running in the current space with the command.
Each XS advanced application runs in a specific run-time container.
System Architecture
Like Cloud Foundry, XS advanced is optimized for 12-Factor applications: the new methodology for building scalable, easy-to-maintain, software-as-a-service applications.
Unlike in XS classic, where design-time artifacts are stored in the SAP HANA Repository, the code base for an XS advanced application is stored in an external Git repository.
Applications are deployed (pushed) from the Git repository to the target platform and run in separate processes that can be scaled independently.
The applications expose services by means of port bindings, store their configuration in the environment, and build upon backing services that are consumed over the network.
XS advanced applications build upon the micro services paradigm and leverage Cloud Foundry tools and services to create, bind, and dispose of services.
XS Advanced System Architecture
XS Advanced System Architecture
Typically, the following service layers are available:
Backing Services
Provide the technology on which XS advanced application are built, for example:
Persistence services (databases, key-value stores, …)
Communication services ( message queues, email gateways, …)
Authentication services (User Account and Authentication service (UAA))
Application Services
Implement business logic and build upon backing services.
Application services are implemented in different languages (for example, Java or JavaScript) for which the platform provides appropriate run-time environment (for example, Tomcat or Node.js).
Communication between application services is always remote since the application services run in isolated containers that are managed by the platform.
Mashup Services
Combining application services, mashup services expose central end points to the user interface that runs as a rich client in a Web browser.
In their simplest form, mashup services perform simple URL-based routing, for example, provided by the XS advanced Application Router (approuter) or the Fiori Launchpad.
However, mashup services can also implement more complex scenarios, for example, the service calls seen in next-generation micro-service based platforms such as hybris-as-a-service (YaaS).
Run-Time Platform
In XS advanced, an application run-time environment comprises lightweight processes that are invoked over HTTP and communicate remotely with the database through a database client ( for example, SQL or MDX).
Each run-time environment provides an execution environment for a specific language and platform, for example, JavaScript (XS JS or Node.js), Java (JavaEE). and even native code written in C or C++.
Higher-level functionality provided by XS classic (for example, the XMLA service and the job scheduler) are implemented as applications on top of those XS advanced run times.
Generic functionality like load balancing, elastic scaling, routing, identity and access management, API management, and application lifecycle management are provided by an XS run-time platform underneath the XS advanced run-time environments.
The XS advanced run-time platform provides a number of services for managing the various container instances and their run-time environments.
Containers manage run-time environments and allow for isolation, resource management and shared service injection.
Besides the functionality for starting and stopping containers, the XS advanced run-time platform provides a monitoring service for obtaining an overview of the started container instances, run-time environments, and applications.
This service also includes information about consumed resources, for example: memory, CPU, network, and file resources.
Authentication and Authorization
When a user sends an unauthenticated request to the central entry point of an XS advanced application such as the XS advanced Application Router (or any other mashup service), the user is redirected to the XS advanced User Account and Authentication (UAA) service.
The UAA can handle different types of authentication methods, for example: basic (user name and password) and SAML assertions.
The UAA does not store user credentials itself; relies on an external user store, for example:
SAP Cloud Identity or also the HANA database.
Upon successful login, the UAA issues an OAuth token that can then be forwarded in all calls to further application services to authenticate that user.
This way, application services only need to support one single authentication method:
OAuth tokens.
By contrast, authentication at backing services like databases is based on technical users that are authenticated with user credentials (name and password) provided to the application in its environment.
The user’s OAuth token can also be forwarded to a backing service such as the SAP HANA database for user-based authorizations.
OAuth tokens not only provide a unified authentication method, they also contain the user’s authorization in the form of a set of permissions, called scopes.
Authorization scopes are managed in the UAA and can be derived for example from SAML roles or attributes.
Based on these scopes, applications perform functional authorization checks on all service layers, either modeled or implemented in code.
Instance-based authorization is based on attributes that can be included in the OAuth token but, more often, are managed by the XS advanced application itself.
Component Model
In a microservice architecture such as the one provided with XS advanced, the following rules apply:
Service life cycle
Each service has its own independent life cycle and must provide stable service interfaces for robust integration with other services that may be upgraded or even completely replaced at different times.
Service isolation and independence
Services are isolated from each other and share nothing.
If common frameworks or libraries need to be shared, they are embedded redundantly (and possible in different versions) in each service.
Service language and run time
Services can be implemented in any available language and run in any available run time environment, independently of the languages and run-time environments used to implement other services.
Service extensions
Services can provide extensions to other services, either by wrapping or replacing existing services with extended implementations or implementing predefined extension point service interfaces.
Additionally, new applications can be aggregated from existing and new services by combining them in a mashup service.
To facilitate the deployment of groups of services which in their specific combination constitute a business application that is managed as a whole, XS advanced introduces the concept of Multi-Target-Applications (MTAs) that can be deployed in one step and share the same life cycle but otherwise retain their independence.
This approach brings an important operations benefit that is also supported in the Cloud.
Client User Interface
The UI model assumes a rich client that communicates via HTTP with application services in the Cloud (for example using the OData protocol for UI5 based user interfaces).
The SAP standard UI technologies, Fiori and UI5, follow this model.
To overcome the same-origin policy restriction implemented in Web browsers, the UI client connects to a central entry point such as the XS advanced Application Router or a mashup service that acts as reverse proxy and routes inbound requests to the appropriate XS advanced application service.
Native clients that are not subject to the restrictions of a Web browser should follow this model to simplify configuration, hide internal implementation details, and provide central login (and logout) services.
The same reasons (of simplicity, implementation details, and central login services) also apply when deciding whether to use Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in the browser as an alternative solution to the same-origin policy restriction.
Fiori applications can be served by a central XS advanced Application Router that reads UI content and routing configuration from the layered repository (LRep) backing service.
As a result, Fiori applications do not need to deploy a dedicated XS advanced Application Router; they just have to deploy their Fiori content to the shared LRep.
By contrast, plain (non-Fiori) UI5 applications embed their UI content in their own XS advanced Application Router which also acts as a Web server for content packaged with its own container; these UI5 applications do not rely on a backing service as an external content repository.
OData Services
To support OData, the SAP-recommended protocol for REST-based data access, XS advanced provides a selection of OData server libraries for the supported run-time environments, for example, Java and JavaScript (Node.js).
XS advanced applications can implement own data providers based on these OData libraries.
However, more typically, XS advanced applications simply model the database objects that must be exposed to client requests by annotating CDS views or defining <locked-ref> metadata artifacts; the applications can then make use of the generic data providers that interpret these models.
It is also possible to use a combination of these two approaches, for example, where the generic data providers perform the data-intensive tasks, and application data providers exit to perform for example data validations or transformations.
SAP HANA Database
As Extended Application Services (XS) to the HANA database, XS advanced provides support for SAP HANA as the database backing service.
SAP HANA Service Broker
HDI Container
HDI Deployer
SAP HANA Instance Broker
Synonyms
Core Data Services
SAP HANA Service Broker
Service Brokers are the components that manage backing services.
An application that requires a particular instance of a backing service defines this dependency, and the platform interacts with the service-specific Service Broker to create a dedicated instance for the application and binds the application to it.
The SAP HANA Service Broker provides various types of service instances according to the service plan the application requires.
First and foremost, these are HDI containers; however, plain schemata are also possible.
Both types of service plan provide isolation in a shared database so that XS advanced applications do not get exclusive access to a complete SAP HANA system; the applications have access to a container which allows multiple applications (or different versions of one application) to share an SAP HANA system.
When an application is started, the platform passes the connection parameters and credentials of the container to the XS advanced application in its environment.
For this reason, applications do not need to hard-code the names of any schema or provide access to global tables; XS advanced applications are isolated within their assigned container.
Multiple applications within one MTA may share a container if they share the same life cycle.
However, different MTAs that have different life cycles are assigned different containers.
HDI Container
HDI Containers are a special type of database schemata that manage their contained database objects.
These objects are described in design-time artifacts that are deployed by the HDI Deployer application.
HDI takes care of dependency management and determines the order of activation; HDI also provides support for upgrading existing run-time artifacts when their corresponding design-time artifacts are modified.
Applications that use other persistency frameworks are obliged to fall back on the use of plain schemata.
These frameworks can then directly execute DDL statements, something that is not allowed in HDI Containers, where the management of database objects is performed exclusively by HDI.
HDI Deployer
The HDI Deployer is an application that is included in an MTA and is used to deploy HDI design-time artifacts to the respective HDI containers.
When an MTA is deployed, the HDI Deployer application is pushed first so that it can prepare the SAP HANA persistence; by the time defined services are started in XS advanced, the HDI container is ready for use.
The same pattern used for the HDI Deployer is also applied with other backing services in XS advanced.
For example, the SDS Deployer deploys Streaming Analytics artifacts, and the LRep Deployer deploys FLP content to the Layered Repository.
The common approach is that dedicated XS advanced applications initialize backing service instances for MTAs and are coordinated by the deployment process as defined in the MTA deployment descriptor.
In addition to the stand-alone deployer application, HDI also offers an API that enables applications to create database objects at run time by generating design-time artifacts within the application and deploying them into their container with the HDI.
In this way, it is possible to extend the persistence in run-time authoring scenarios, for example, field extensibility or dynamic rule generation.
SAP HANA Instance Broker
The SAP HANA Instance Broker provides dynamic access to multiple containers (HDI Containers or plain schemata) for applications that implement their multi-tenancy data separation by tenant-specific containers.
Whereas the SAP HANA Service Broker provides a static binding of an application to its container, the SAP HANA Instance Broker provides an API for applications to request and obtain the connection parameters and credentials required to access a tenant-specific container.
Synonyms
In XS advanced, applications only connect to their own database container (or in the case of multi-tenancy: their containers); an XS advanced application but cannot connect directly to containers bound to other applications.
Explicit schema references are not allowed or even possible because they are dynamically created and managed by the SAP HANA Service Broker.
This is in line with the decentralized data management concept in a micro-services architecture.
However, from a performance perspective and also from a data-consistency perspective, replication is not always the best answer.
So, the SAP HANA database provides synonyms that enable an XS advanced application to perform a controlled break out from its own container to related containers.
A database synonym is similar to a symbolic link; from an application's perspective, the access always happens within its own container, but the synonym may link to an object in another container.
A container that exposes objects to other containers must explicitly grant access to consuming containers in order to create synonyms.
The container exposing objects with synonyms has control over the set of objects which can be accessed.
As a result, the exposing container has the means to define an application programming interface (API) at the database level, for example, by white-listing only public objects in a database role that is granted to the consuming container.
The complete setup and deployment of synonyms is done by the HDI Deployer; it is not necessary for application developers to configure this manually.
Core Data Services
For SAP HANA, Core Data Services (CDS) is the preferred language for the modeling of your data persistence objects and, as a result, fully supported by XS advanced.
The following rules apply:
Deployment infrastructure
With SAP HANA Deployment Infrastructure (HDI) and the HDI Deployer, the CDS models are deployed to HDI containers
Run-time environments
The language run-time environments included with XS advanced provide client libraries for easy consumption of CDS at run time, for example.
JavaScript
JavaScript Data Services (node-cds API) include a native JavaScript client and query builder for Core Data Services (CDS) for node.js on SAP HANA XS Advanced Model; node-cds enables programs to consume SAP-HANA-based records as native JavaScript objects.
The node-cds library supports basic CRUD operations and complex queries on all data types (native SAP HANA and defined in CDS), and covers associations, transactions, and lazy navigation.
The Java Data Services (JDS) for XS advanced provides a set of tools that facilitate the consumption of Core Data Services (CDS) artifacts in Java applications.
JDS enables you to map existing CDS data models to the corresponding Java Persistence API (JPA) 2.1 data models so that they can be consumed by Java applications.
Data access
You can use the CDS Data Control Language (DCL) to model instance-based authorizations XS advanced.

Option
Description
To configure SSO for local connections through JDBC
Exit the information design tool.
Open the InformationDesignTool.ini file for editing.
It is located at the bip-install-dir \win32_x86 directory.
Add the following lines:
where location is the configuration file directory on the machine where Connection Server is running.
Save the file.
Restart the information design tool.
To configure SSO for connections located on the CMS through JDBC
The objective is to configure the Adaptive Connectivity Service.
Open the CMC.
Under Connectivity Services, stop the Adaptive Connectivity Service hosted by the Adaptive Processing Server.
Go to the Properties page.
Add the following options to the Command Line Parameters property:
where location is the configuration file directory on the machine where Connection Server is running.
Click Save.
Restart the service from the CMC.
These steps also allow you to configure SSO for all other Java services, such as the Data Federation services.
You use Data Federation services when querying on a multisource-enabled universe built on an SAP HANA connection.
Supervisor Record Learning Work Area
Supervisors can use this information to record course completion for users.
Supervisors can record learning for their employees in the My Employees tab.
You record learning when the system cannot do it by itself: for example, when your employee completed an external event or completed a classroom course.
When you click Record Learning the record learning wizard opens.
Audit Data
When you record a learning event, the system collects data for an audit trail.
When your organization or the employee is audited for learning history, the data you enter can be part of the audit.
Types of Learning Hours
This topic contains the types of learning hours that the Learning Management System (LMS) records.
This topic contains the default, recommended usage of learning hours for auditing purposes.
Your organization might use hours differently.
Learning Hours Recommended Usage
Name of Hour Type
Usage
Total Hours
The Total Hours type is the total number of hours that you expect a user to be engaged in completing a learning event.
If the course is divided into segments of time, the system defaults total hours to the sum of the time in all the segments.
The hours to sum differ slightly depending on what you are recording.
If the user attended a specific course (scheduled offering), then the system calculates the difference between the start and end times of each segment, adds those values, and places that in the Total Hours box.
If the user attended a course that doesn't have a specific record in the system and you are recording against the default settings for the courses (an item) then the system adds the duration values for each segment in the default (item) record and places that in the Total Hours box.
Credit Hours
Credit hours are the number of hours that a user earns for completing a learning event.
For example, in many U.S. colleges, students attend a single class for 15 weeks, 3 days each week, and 1 hour each day.
In this case, the total hours equals 45; however, the college grants 3 credit hours for this class.
Contact Hours
Contacts hours are the total number of hours that you expect a user to have contact with an instructor.
For example, if you set up a blended item that has 8 total hours and, for 6 of those hours, you expect the user to be in an instructor-led segment, then the contact hours equals 6.
CPE Hours
CPE is an abbreviation for "Continuing Professional Education."
CPE refers to learning activities that users perform to maintain and expand the skills that their profession demands.
Therefore, CPE hours are very much like credit hours Credit hours are the number of hours that a user earns for completing a learning event.
For example, in many U.S. colleges, students attend a single class for 15 weeks, 3 days each week, and 1 hour each day.
In this case, the total hours equals 45; however, the college grants 3 credit hours for this class., but the accumulation of CPE hours often leads to a professional certification.
Course Scheduling Records
This topic describes the default and recommended use of the learning completion data.
This data is important to create an audit trail of your users' learning.
This topic contains the default, recommended usage of completion data for auditing purposes.
Your organization might use the data differently.
Course Schedule Data for Audits
Data Name
Audit Trail Application
Completion Date and Time
In audit reports, the completion date and time is when the user completed the learning.
When you record learning for a user, the completion date and time must be in the past because the user must have already completed the item before you record the event.
If the system knows the completion time, it populates the date and time for you.
Completion Time Zone
The system uses the time zone to be specific about the completion date and time.
Select the time zone that matches the users' completion.
Instructor Information
The instructors' name or ID identifies the instructor teaching the course.
If more than one instructor taught the course, choose the primary instructor.
Default Grade
The default grade is a flexible way to record a users' performance in a course.
Use your organizations' system for grading (letters, percentages, or numbers, for example).
Course Completion and Grading for Records
This topic describes how course completion and grading affects your organization's completion records.
Course Completion and Grading Data for Audits
Name
Description
Default Grade
The default grade is a flexible way to record a users' performance in a course.
Use your organizations' system for grading (letters, percentages, or numbers, for example).
Completion Status
If the system can find the default completion status for the course, it populates the completion status for you.
Use the status that the system finds for you unless you know it should be different.
Recording Costs for Learning Events
This topic describes how costs are recorded for learning events.
When you record a learning event for a user, you have the opportunity to record the cost of the event.
Select the currency and then type the amount that the event cost by category (Transportation, Lodging, and so on).
Learning administrators control the categories for your organization.
Register/Withdraw Employees Work Area
This topic describes how supervisors can register and withdraw users from courses.
As a supervisor, you interact directly with your team of employees most often, and you are better positioned to understand what scheduled offerings a particular employee needs or doesn't need.
Therefore, you can use the Registration wizard to manage those needs by withdrawing or registering users for scheduled offerings.
You can only enroll or withdraw users from scheduled offerings that have not yet started.
When you register a user, you can enter comments about registering the user.
For example, you might want to inform the instructor of any special needs or circumstances about a user you have registered.
Administrators can access your comments by viewing the scheduled offering record; end users never see your comments.
Approvals Work Area
Use this information to manage your standard approval process in the Approvals work area.
When you use the standard approval process, each request for training can be approved or denied.
If you are requesting approval for training, use the approvals work area to monitor your requests.
If you approve requests for training, use the approvals work area to make the approval or to deny the request.
You can monitor or approve the following types of training requests in the Approvals work area:
External Requests: approval to attend an external training event
Internal Requests: approval to attend an internal training event
E-Signature (Electronic Signature) Verification:
An approval step that requires you to enter your e-signature code
Dashboard Work Area
The My Employees' Dashboard was designed so that supervisors can investigate the status of the responsibilities for their direct reports.
In the Employee To-Dos section, you can customize what the list shows by changing the selections in the Show and Due Date lists.
For example, if you want to see which of your employees are behind on their learning, then you could select Learning from the Show list and Overdue from the Due Date list.
You could then remind and encourage these employees the importance of keeping their responsibilities current.
You could also use this information to remove learning items for a user if, for example, you think the user was assigned too many items.
Report Work Area
In the report work area, you can run reports about your courses.
reports follow these conventions:
Bunched reports deliver the same information, but grouped and sorted differently.
For example, User Curriculum Status Group By Curriculum Details and User Curriculum Status Group By Item Details both show users' curriculum status, but one report is grouped by the curriculum details and the other by the course (item) details.
Reports with "(CSV)" in the title deliver the information in a Comma-Separated Values (CSV) format so that you can open them in a spreadsheet editor like Microsoft Excel.
Default Learning Reports
The reports available to you can vary depending on the configuration of your system.
These reports are available by default.
When you run a report, the system consolidates information from a variety of areas into a single report, which allows you to perform a targeted analysis of key data.
This table contains only learning reports, not legacy reports.
Report Name
Purpose
Active Goals
The purpose of the Active Goals report is to show all active goals.
Active goals are all goals that are on a user’s approved plans, including any plans that have expired.
While you can use the Active Goals report for a single user and a single approved plan, you get the most from the Active Goals report by consolidating active goals from multiple users or multiple plans into a single report.
You can group the report by the name of the goal or by the name of the user.
The report shows the goal name, description, goal type, target date, priority, category, weight (the report shows “N/A” for development or personal goals), status, and percent toward target.
As a user without subordinates, you can use the Active Goals report to consolidate the goals from your approved plans into a single report, giving you a progress report for your active goals and associated activities.
As a user with subordinates, you can use the Active Goals Report as progress report that shows the active goals for each subordinate’s approved plans.
Close-Fit Jobs
You can use the Close-Fit Jobs report to see which job positions are most suitable for your employees and to identify subordinates who are qualified, overqualified, or underqualified for their current job or for a job that might open soon.
If you identify employees who are overqualified for their current job positions, then you can promote them to other job positions that fit more closely with their competencies.
If you identify employees who are underqualified for their current job positions, then you can reassign them to other job positions that fit more closely with their competencies.
In a Close-Fit Jobs report, you can assess an employee’s qualification level for a job position by using the cumulative competency gap.
The cumulative competency gap equals the sum of all competency gaps (for competencies associated with the job position) divided by the number of competencies associated with the job position.
The cumulative competency gap can be positive, zero, or negative.
Users have a positive cumulative competency gap if and only if they have a positive competency gap for every competency associated with the job position.
Generally, a positive cumulative competency gap identifies users as overqualified for the job position.
Users have a negative cumulative competency gap when they have at least one competency rating that is below the required competency rating.
When users have both positive and negative competency gaps, the report changes the positive competency gaps to zero so that the cumulative competency gap will still be negative.
That is, even though a user might have a strength (positive competency gap) for most of the competencies associated with the job position, the user doesn’t meet all of the competency requirement levels for the job position; therefore, the report must show a negative cumulative competency gap for that job position.
Generally, a negative cumulative competency gap identifies users as underqualified for the job position.
The summary section of the report shows the strengths (the average peer rating is greater than the user’s self rating) for each user while the details section of the report lists the close-fit job positions, the cumulative gap, and the competency with the largest gap, including the value of the gap (the gap equals the peer rating minus the user rating).
If users have not been evaluated for a competency associated with a job position, then the report treats the competency rating as zero.
A zero rating on any competency causes the greatest competency gap and the greatest cumulative competency gap.
Therefore, when you assess a user’s close-fit job report, be sure to account for unrated competencies.
Competency Assessment Comparison
You can use the Competency Assessment Comparison report to compare the competency ratings for a user with the organization average and the company average.
If a user is assigned a competency, but has not yet been rated for that competency, then the report excludes that user for that competency.
Competency Assessment Trend
Supervisors use the Competency Assessment Trend report to see if the competency ratings of their direct reports have improved or declined over time.
Each user could have up to five competency ratings for each competency.
For example, if you select 3 Months from the Historical Trend Interval list, then the first (most recent) competency rating appears in the Current Rating column; the second competency rating appears in the Last Rating column; and the third, fourth, and fifth competency ratings appear in the Historical Trend column.
Curriculum Status
As a supervisor, you can use the Curriculum Status report to review which users have fallen behind on completing their assigned curricula.
Employee Dropoff
You can use the Employee Dropoff report to show users whose supervisor rating has fallen significantly from the previous review to the most recently published review (you define the significance of the dropoff using Gap Threshold).
To be included in the report, the user must have more than one review, and the most recent supervisor rating must be lower than the previous supervisor rating.
Employee/Supervisor Ratings Gap
You can use Employee/Supervisor Ratings Gap report to show users whose self rating was significantly different from their supervisor’s rating (you define the significance of the gap using Gap Threshold).
The gap can be positive or negative: the supervisor can have the higher or the lower rating of the two.
The report shows all gaps from the most recent performance review.
Item Requests
As a supervisor or learning coordinator, you can use the Item Requests report to identify which items might require an additional scheduled offering to meet current demands or needs.
Item Status
You can run the Item Status report to show the completion dates and statuses for items in the learning history.
Learning History
As a supervisor, you can use the Learning History report to list all of the items that your direct or indirect reports have completed.
You can use this report to compare each user’s performance and their status for the item.
Learning Hours
You can run the Learning Hours report to display the details for events in the user learning history that include course length, credit hours, CPE hours, and contact hours.
Learning Needs
You can run the Learning Needs report to view the assigned items that remain on a user’s to-do list.
This report can be filtered to show only required learning.
Learning Plan
You can run the Learning Plan report to display all of the items a user has been assigned.
This report includes completion dates where applicable, and it can be filtered to show only learning needs or required assignments.
Tuition
The Tuition report displays the amount the user paid in order to launch, register, or complete an item.
User Information
The User Information report shows basic information about each user.
You can use this report, for example, to troubleshoot some common issues, such as ensuring that users have email addresses when they say that they are not receiving email notifications.

Learning Assignments and Learning History
Your learning assignments are courses you need to complete and your learning history is the list of courses you have already completed.
This topic describes the two lists.
Your learning assignments list includes all work you need to do, including learning items, scheduled offerings, and curricula.
It is the central place for your assignments.
Your learning history is a record of the work that you completed.
When you finish a course, it moves from the learning assignments list to the learning history list.
Completing a Task Checklist Evaluation
A task checklist is a type of exam where an observer watches a participant complete a task and marks off the steps in a checklist.
This topic describes how you complete the checklist.
About Task Checklists
A task checklist contains all of the tasks that users should be able to complete as a result of successfully learning the content of a learning item.
As a user, a task checklist allows you to demonstrate your mastery of an item by demonstrating that you can complete each task that is associated with the item.
If your administrator enabled a task checklist for an item, then the system places the item on your assignments list with a Request Observation action.
You can also request an observation by viewing the item details for the item.
Nominating an Observer
If you are assigned a task checklist, your first step is to nominate other users to observe you complete the task.
The observer's job is to watch you complete the task and to fill out a checklist that shows you completing each step in the task.
To nominate a user, click Request Observation.
You can search for and add any number of observers but only one observer can submit the results.
You can continue to add or remove observers until an observer submits your task checklist with a completion status.
When you add or remove an observer, the system places the item on the observer's assignment list with an Open Observation action.
The observer can also launch the task checklist from the item details page.
Completing a Task Checklist
To complete a task checklist, open the checklist (click Open Observation).
For each task in the list, silently read the task description and check the correct completion status.
If you observe the person completing the task, mark the task complete.
If not, mark it incomplete.
You can also add comments for each individual task or for the entire checklist of tasks.
When the observation is over, you can record completion or record failure.
In some situations, you could have task status of incorrect but still click Record Completion for the entire task checklist.
Likewise, there are situations where you might have a task status of correct for all tasks but still click Record Failure for the entire task checklist.
Your company or supervisor should provide guidance on the standards to use to determine completion or failure for a task checklist.
SF Learning Ref Content
Every performance review form contains three common sections (Welcome, Overview, and Confirm and Submit) and a variable number of other sections, which your company configures.
Plateau legacy applications require the Flash-based legacy interface.
For help with that interface, see the legacy help.
People who can Assign Courses to You
The Things That can Appear on Your Assignments List
Plateau Legacy Flash Help
Item Events and External Events
An "item event" exists in the Learning Management System (LMS): you can find it in the system.
If you click Item based event in the Record Learning wizard and you can find your course, then your course is an item event.
If you cannot find the course, then your course is an external event.
Start over and select External event.
Before you record an external learning event go to Home Links External Requests and look for external events to verify.
Verifying an external event is different from recording external events.
When you record an external learning event, the system cannot find default values for you so complete the forms carefully.
Depending on how your organization has configured, you might see different options in the program.
All users have the Home tab.
If you are a supervisor, you also see the My Employees tab.
Offline Learning
There are two ways to view content when you are not connected to the internet: legacy Plateau Offline and Mobile Learning.
This topic describes the difference between the two.
Mobile Offline
Mobile Learning downloads learning assignments to your mobile device, where you can view content (videos, web pages, and so on).
Your learning administrator can restrict the content that can be downloaded to Mobile Learning.
Download the mobile app from your app store.
Legacy Plateau Offline
You can download learning content and legacy Plateau assessments to Plateau Offline, which is a Windows application.
After you download them, you can disconnect from your network and work on them.
Because Plateau Offline works disconnected, it is ideal for users who travel with a laptop or who have a slow network connection or who need offline access to Plateau Assessments.
Plateau Offline tracks the content objects you complete while you are offline.
When you log back in to the user interface, the system synchronizes with Plateau Offline.
The system locks Plateau assessments that you download.
If you attempt to download the assessment again, you see a warning that you can lose your work.
Working with Competency Assessments
Use this information to understand how competency assessments relate to learning.
A competency assessment is an employee performance tool.
It asks other employees to evaluate how competent you are in areas that matter to your organization.
Competency assessments start in employee performance, but they matter to because your courses can help you achieve high scores in your competency assessments.
In fact, you can receive an automatic competency assessment when you complete a course that addresses one of your competencies.
For example, if you earn credit for a writing course, the system can update a "written communication" competency.
Users of Plateau legacy products cannot use competency assessments.
Earning Credit for Courses
offers you more than one way to earn credit.
This topic describes how the system assesses your progress.
As you progress through your learning assignments, the system stops from time to time to assess your progress in your learning goals and it offers several ways to earn credit:
Some courses grant credit when you start and complete them.
Some courses grant credit when you pass an exam.
A few courses have alternative ways of assessing your skills and knowledge:
Task checklists are a special type of exam: an observer watches you complete a task and indicates that you completed the steps in the task and that you were successful.
Some users, like administrators, can assign credit directly through the record learning process.
Links Tile (Work Areas)
This topic describes work areas that you can launch from the Links tile.
The work areas manage workflows like requests, orders, and approvals.
A work area manages tasks that are related to your courses, like seeking approval to take an external course or running reports about your courses.
Often, an administrator removes unused workspace links.
For example, if your organization does not purchase courses, then your administrator can remove the My Orders link.
External Requests Work Area
The external request work area is for organizations that require that you complete an electronic form as part of an approval process for external training: training that is outside of your organization.
For example, United States Federal customers to use a form called "SF-182" to request external training.
provides a work area for external requests at Home Links External Requests..
In the work area, you can:
Complete and submit an online form requesting external courses
View forms that have been sent to you for approval, and then approve or deny the request with a reason
External Request (SF-182) Workflow
The phrase "External Request" can be confusing.
The workflow uses the phrase even after a request has been approved.
A request can have multiple phases, including approved.
Completing an External Request Form
Go to Home Links External Requests.
To open a blank form, click New Request.
To reuse a form, changing only the form fields that need to change, click Copy Request next to the form you want to copy.
After you complete the form, follow the workflow wizard to send the form for approval.
If you need help completing the form, click the Instructions link to open instructions on your particular form.
Approving or Denying Requests
When you have pending approval requests, you see an alert:
Home My Learning Assignments You have pending approval requests.
You can either click the alert or click Home Links Approvals to open the approvals work area.
You use the same approvals work area whether you are approving an external request, approving the verification of an external request, or approving some other kind of request, such as internal training.
In the approvals work area, go to Training External Training and then follow the workflow wizard to approve or deny the request.
Your organization might have multiple steps in the workflow, but at the end of the process, the request appears in the user's assignments list and the user's external request work area.
Identifying Upcoming External Training
To identify upcoming external training events, go to Home My Assignments Filter, and then select External Requests from the course types list.
Verifying an External Request
After you attend an event, you verify that you attended it.
To verify your attendance, go to Home Links External Requests.
Find the request that corresponds to your event and click Verify.
Follow the workflow wizard to complete verification.
After you verify your attendance, the event appears in your history.
In many cases, you can verify your attendance by yourself.
In some cases, an administrator must verify your attendance.
News Page Work Area
This topic describes the news page, a read-only workspace that your organization can use to post information about.
When you log on, the system displays a news page that your company can use to communicate with you.
You can select Do not show this page every time I sign in to hide the page until the content changes.
To open the hidden news page, click Home Links News.

History
The History tile contains the list of courses that you completed.
Use it to check that you have earned credit for completed courses.
To see your learning history, go to Home History.
You can see the number of courses you recently completed on the tile.
Click the History tile to see all completed courses.
Courses appear on the history list when you complete a course from your assignments, when you verify that you attended an external event, or when you or someone else records that you completed a course.
Record Learning Work Area
Use this information to understand how the record learning work area affects your learning history.
The most common reason to use the record learning work area is to record your completion of an offline course: a course you attended in a classroom.
Click Home Links Record Learning to get started.
Many organizations remove the record learning link from the Home tab, so if you do not see the link, check with your supervisor to record learning.
My Orders Work Area
The My Orders work area contains your orders for training.
Use these tips to navigate your orders.
An order is a purchase.
The My Orders work area contains a history of your orders and options for ordering more training.
The system allows these purchasing options:
Account code:
Use an account code to charge the purchase training to the account.
The account code usually belongs to your department.
Order ticket:
An order ticket is a voucher that you can use to purchase training.
Coupon:
A coupon reduces or eliminates the cost of training.
Options and Settings Work Area
The Options and Settings work area manages your preferences.
Use this information to understand what you can control in the work area.
Go to Home Links Options and Settings.
In the work area, you can control the following:
Security options: you can reset your password or your security question.
Notification options: you can decide when the system should send you an email message (for example, when a course is added to your assignments).
Regional settings: you can set your time zone, currency, locale (language), and display formats.
Training Planner Work Area
The training planner is a way to seek approval for a course in organizations with centralized planning.
This topic describes how the training planner works.
With the training planner, you submit your training requests in bulk to either the My Requests section (individual requests) or the My Team's Requests (supervisors' requests for a team).
You can add both internal and external requests.
Approval Methods
When you need approval to attend a course, use this topic to understand the different methods for approval.
provides three approval processes.
In most cases, your organization uses only one or two processes.
Approval processes are managed from the Links tile.
Standard approval process:
The standard approval process is the most common.
Your organization creates an approval process with one or more steps.
You manage approvals in the Approvals workspace.
External requests process:
Most commonly used by United States Federal organizations, the external request process uses the standard federal SF-182 form to request external training.
You manage external requests in the External Requests workspace and also the Approvals workspace.
Training planner process:
The training planner is used by organizations that plan their training on a budget period like fiscal year and that have a top-down training approach.
You manage training planner approvals in the Training Planner workspace.

Other Links
Your organization can add links to the Links tile.
This topic explains why your organization might add a link.
Links are highly customizable.
For example, your company might add a link to its intranet in the Links tile, or it might remove the External Requests link if it isn't using the external requests process.
It is also possible that your organization uses Plateau legacy products:
Plateau Performance and Plateau Compensation.
If you use the legacy products, your links are very different from the Links tile.

Using Available Offering Suggestions
The Available Offerings tile suggests courses that can help you meet requirements.
This topic helps you use the tile.
The Available Offerings tile suggests upcoming courses that help you complete part of a curriculum or complete single assignments on your My Learning Assignments list.
The courses are near your location and scheduled to start soon.
You can find the tile in two places:
In the Home tab for courses that help you complete your learning assignments generally.
In the curriculum details page for courses that help you complete the curriculum.
Viewing the Details of Assignments
The details of an assignment can help you judge its importance and preview the course.
Use these tips to view the details.
Your organization can choose to provide details or a cover page for the assignment so that you know what to expect from the course.
Go to Home My Learning Assignments and then click the title of the course.
Many online courses include an introductory overview of the course content, so you can start a course to see what it covers.
In your learning assignments, click Start Course.
Training Planner Roles
Use this information to understand how you fit into the training planner process.
The primary users of the training planner are the training managers, who are responsible for budget approval, but all three roles must consider training needs, and their cost, over the planning time period.
If you are a training manager, your job is to keep your training plan on budget.
Use the workspace to consider your organization's training requests, and approve or deny the requests to stay in budget.
If you are a supervisor, your job is to consider the training needs of your team and submit the requests with their costs.
If you are an employee, your job is to consider your own training needs and submit them, with a cost, to the training manager.
How Requests From Users Roll up to the Training Manager
Training Planner Workflow
Use this information to understand how the training planner accepts requests and approves them.
The training planner is a budget request system.
Employees and supervisors find courses, add headcount and cost information, and then send the requests to the training manager, who approves the budget.
Supervisors can add training requests for their team of employees.
Individual employees can add requests for themselves.
Training Planner Workflow
Assigning Alternate Supervisors
Use this topic to understand how and when you should assign a user to an alternate supervisor.
When users work for an extended period on projects that have them reporting to a different manager or supervisor, then you might want to transfer responsibility for completing the primary supervisor's tasks (for example, assigning or approving learning items) to an alternate supervisor.
When you click Manage Alternate Supervisors, you can identify other users as alternate supervisors and assign primary responsibility to them.
After you assign a user as an alternate supervisor, the system updates the My Employees area of the user interface for that alternate supervisor by including the user for whom they now have responsibility to complete a task.
The alternate supervisor can then proceed to complete the task or to identify another alternate supervisor for this user.
In the user interface, primary and alternate supervisors can assign any responsibility for tasks such that an alternate supervisor could reassign responsibility back to the primary supervisor; however, primary and alternate supervisors cannot remove an alternate supervisor who was included by an administrator.
Users (primary and alternate supervisors) can only remove the alternate supervisors that they have identified or the ones that their alternate supervisors have identified.
Furthermore, alternate supervisors cannot remove themselves from the list of alternate supervisors.
An administrator can remove any alternate supervisor.
Searching in Assign Learning Work Area
When you search in the assign learning work area, the search behaves a little differently than the Find Learning tile.
This topic explains how the search works in the assign learning work area.
In the assign learning work area, the system search is not case sensitive: searching for "ADMIN", "Admin", and "admin" returns the same results.
When you click Search, the system searches the title and description for your search criteria.
Therefore, the title for some of the search results will not match your search criteria.
For example, if you searched for "ADMIN" and the system found a title that is "Communicating Effectively," then the description for Communicating Effectively contains the search string that you specified (that is, it contains "ADMIN").
If you select Exact Phrase, then the system ignores capitalization and searches for the exact phrase, including spaces.
For example, if you select Exact Phrase and search for the keywords "ED AD", then the search results could contain "Advanced Administration Topics" (because the last two letters of "Advanced" and the first two letters of "Administration" are "ed ad").
If you clear Exact Phrase, then the system searches for the exact phrase and uses any spaces in the keywords differently.
If you have multiple keywords, then the system treats each word (as identified by a space) as a separate search.
The search results must contain all words, but the keywords can be in any order.
For example, if you clear Exact Phrase and search for the keywords "simul VANCE", then the search results could contain "Advanced Administrative Support Simulation" (because "simul" is contained in "Simulation" AND "VANCE" is contained in "Advanced").
If you select Search All Languages, then the system returns results from any locale.
To limit the search results to your preferred locale only, then you can clear the Search All Languages check box.

Types of Courses
Learning items, scheduled offerings, and curricula are the three fundamental units of learning in the system.
This topic describes how they interact and why they matter to you.
Learning Items, Scheduled Offerings, Curricula, and Programs
A learning item is similar to a math course you find in a university course catalog: the university tracks your progress in the course and grades you when you complete your exams.
In, your learning administrator tracks your completion in a learning item (for example, workplace safety).
A scheduled offering is similar to one scheduled math course at a university: it can be offered on Mondays at 10 AM and on Wednesdays at 6 PM.
You can attend either one and earn credit.
In, your learning administrator wants to know which of the scheduled workplace safety courses you attended.
A curriculum is similar to a degree in the university: if you earn your degree in mathematics, you have taken a number of required math courses and some elective courses.
In, a curriculum is smaller than a university degree, but it has similar rules and requirements, and you cannot complete the curriculum until you have completed your required courses.
For example, the workplace safety course can be part of a larger Safety and Security Basics curriculum that covers workplace safety, computer security, building security, and travel safety.
A program is like a curriculum except that it accounts for its hours differently and uses different rules to determine which courses you take.
Programs are often informal groups of learning items.

Password Security
Description
Passwords are a familiar way to verify the identity of users and systems.
Passwords are simpler and cheaper than other, more secure forms of authentication like smart cards or biometric scanners.
They provide a simple, direct means of protecting a system or an account.
However, there are also known weaknesses.
Password cracking is the process of figuring out or breaking passwords in order to gain unauthorized access to a system or an account.
Many passwords are not random but trivial to guess.
A more technical way of cracking passwords is through network sniffers, which look at the raw data transmitted across the network and decipher its contents, including passwords.
Furthermore, attackers can try to crack passwords offline when they can access the hashed password string during transmission or in an insecure password store.
The password-based approach of authentication can be used to protect applications when the following advice is taken into consideration.
What Do I Get from the Platform?
The overall process of password-based identification and authentication is as follows.
First, the application asks for the user identification, usually the user's account name.
Then the password is read and a hash-value of the password is calculated.
Often a salt, that is a random string of data, is added in order to prevent an attacker from testing known dictionary words.
Some password components also wipe the memory in which the password was stored.
Finally, the system checks whether the hashed user input and the stored hash value of the password match.
If they do, the user is successfully authenticated.
The platform provides an authentication mechanism of the type described above.
We recommend that, in general, you use the existing password authentication mechanism provided by the platform instead of implementing one of your own.
What Do I Need to Do?
The issues described above necessitate that you handle user IDs and passwords carefully.
The following recommendations may help to prevent an unauthorized person gaining access to your system:
Are passwords displayed in plaintext?
Do not display passwords in plaintext, use asterisks instead.
Are passwords saved or transmitted in plaintext?
Passwords transmitted in plaintext can be intercepted, rendering the user ID and password method of identification insecure.
It is better to transmit passwords using a secure communication protocol, such as the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol.
Do not save passwords in plaintext.
Avoid the administrator gaining access to the password.
Use secure hash functions to prevent password recovery.
The platform uses secure hash values to store passwords.
Do not invent your own coding to encrypt the original password.
Are passwords hard-coded in the source code?
Use a technology such as one-time passwords.
Use the Destination Service instead (for more information, see Secure Communication ).
Do not invent your own encryption algorithm.
Are no passwords recorded in log/protocol/trace files?
Do not use HTTP GET requests since all parameters will be found in the URL.
Use HTTP POST requests instead.
In general, you should avoid transmitting passwords, in particular with every request you send.
Use secure mechanisms instead, such as digital certificates for example.
Take into account that the Web Server logs all the URLs.
Passwords may also be displayed in readable form when tracing, depending on the trace settings.
Are passwords in plaintext overwritten in memory once they are no longer used?
Do overwrite passwords in memory, otherwise they might still exist in memory even after completion of the application and could thus be read by a malicious application.
Are the user ID and password preconfigured or callable through a pull-down menu at the start of the application?
It is better to avoid using any pull-down menus for the user ID/password entry.
This is particularly important for the password.
Can all passwords, IDs and user names be changed?
Non-changeable IDs and passwords often form the starting point for attacks on an application's security.

The course catalogs from these partners must be enabled in the LMS by an administrator for the external content to be available in catalogs, grouped into learning systems like curricula, or directly assigned to users by administrators or supervisors.
To access external content, go to Home Find Learning Browse all courses Catalog Search Web Courses.
From Web Courses, you can view available external content, add a course to your assignments, or simply launch the course.
After the external content course is launched, click the course link that takes you to the partner website.
Keep in mind:
When you launch an external content course, you launch the provider's site to interact with the course outside.
You will need to log in to some external content course websites before accessing their external content.
Course completions are either self-completed or by certificates, which are determined by organization.

My QuickGuides Work Area
View this section if you want to know about My QuickGuides.
Some users can create QuickGuides, which are step-by-step instructions that can quickly create with your phone or browser and then upload to your learning catalog for others to see.
If you are a user who can create QuickGuides, you can create a description that is searchable in the catalog and that is displayed when launching the guide.
For example, if your QuickGuide is entitled, "Forwarding Calls from your PC", your description could be, "This describes how to forward phone calls on your office phone when you need to look up the extension."
If your company gives you access to QuickGuides, you can bookmark them from search results or a launched guide.
You can access bookmarks from your home page in the Bookmarks tile.
Home Tab Tiles
View this section if you want to know about Home tab tiles.
The Home Tab tiles can be moved around and re-sized during your session, but keep in mind that in some environments, they will return to the default size and location the next time you log in.
Curricula and Programs
This topic describes the extra features of learning assignments when the assignments are part of a curriculum or program.
Curricula and programs group courses together so that you can reach a learning goal.
For example, a curriculum might group together food washing, storage, and preparation courses to teach safe food handling to kitchen staff.
Although curricula and programs work a little differently, you complete both the same way: you complete the assignments in the group.
The assignments appear in Home My Learning Assignments.
How Programs and Curricula Differ
In general, curricula are designed to be rigid and formal for learning compliance.
Programs are designed to be flexible and easier to use.
Programs can have external content like videos and links.
Unlike curricula, external content in programs does not need to be part of a formal course that you need to find in the Find Learning tile.
Instead, it can just be a link.
In curricula, you often must earn a passing completion status in a prerequsite to take the next course.
Programs do not have formal prerequisites, but they do suggest an order.
You rarely need to find courses to fulfill a program, but you often need to find courses to fulfill curricula.
How to Find Courses that Match your Curriculum Requirements
If you are responsible for finding the courses that meet your curriculum, here are some tips:
To look at your curriculum and decide how you want to complete its assignments, go to Home My Curricula.
To look for courses that help you complete your curriculum, go to Home Available Offerings.
To substitute another course for the one you are currently assigned, go to Home My Learning Assignments,, and then click the title of the assignment.
Click the View Substitute link.
Substitutes are courses that count toward your curriculum instead of the course you have been assigned.

What's New in Implementing Employee Central Payroll Time Sheet
Q1 2019
What's New
More Info
When setting up dynamic breaks, you can now choose:
Whether breaks will be generated using partial or full deduction
Whether any and all gaps in working time will be considered as breaks
Updated screenshots showing the sample rules.
When importing external time data, the timeSheetImportExternalTimes job will now only consider data that is less than 10 weeks old.
This will significantly improve the speed and general performance of the job, as previously it would often consider a huge range of data stretching back months or years.
If you want, you can restrict the range of the job even further, or increase it to a maximum of 20 weeks.
In Configure Object Definitions, open the Time Management Configuration object and set the Weeks relevant for time sheet import job field to visible.
Then go to the object and enter a value between 1 and 20 in that field.

Dynamic breaks
If you want, you can now specify that employees are entitled to dynamic rather than fixed breaks.
The difference between the two is that fixed breaks are always at a particular time (for example, from 12:00- 12:45) whereas dynamic breaks occur automatically after an employee has worked a certain amount of time (for example, after 6 hours of work they are entitled to a 45-minute break).
