What is it?
Data lake is a fully managed cloud service for securely storing and analyzing large amounts of data that is infrequently updated.
It leverages inexpensive storage options to lower costs, while maintaining excellent performance and full SQL access to data.
For more information on data lake, please visit the SAP HANA, Data Lake product page.
Connect Data Lake
To use the data lake in your space, select the checkbox Use this space to access the data lake.
Currently, only one space can connect to data lake.
If you can't select this box, it means another space already has been selected to connect to data lake.
Working with Data Lake
You can now use your preferred SQL tool to create tables in data lake and access these tables via SAP HANA virtual tables in your open SQL schema.
SAP Data Warehouse Cloud offers two stored procedures that you can use to easily create and access the tables.
For more detailed information and examples on the stored procedures openData Lake API.
Using the Procedures
In your SQL tool, use the "DWC_GLOBAL"."DATA_LAKE_EXECUTE" ( IN STMT NCLOB ) stored procedure in the schema DWC_GLOBAL to create tables in data lake.
Please note, that the statements issued via this procedure are not audited.
Then create SAP HANA virtual tables in your open SQL schema that refer to the tables in data lake.
The virtual tables are used to query the tables in data lake.
Use the following stored procedure to do this:
You can now work with your SAP HANA virtual tables in the Data Builder by selecting the open SQL schema used for the data lake.

In the Business Catalog, you can find the right model to create a story for analysis thanks to the semantic layer, its descriptions, its tags, and the assignment of a business use.
The Business Catalog gives an overview of all the models you can use, across all the Spaces you are authorized for.
When there are too many models, not all the models are shown at once.
You can load more models by choosing Show more at the end of the list.
The models are grouped using the following categories:
analytical datasets:
An analytical dataset is data that indicates a specific transaction, like the sale of a product.
Analytical datasets can be used for stories.
dimensions:
Dimensions are used to group data whose content is logically connected.
The customer dimension could, for example, be made up of the customer number, the customer group and the levels of the customer hierarchy.
relational datasets:
A relational dataset is the basic format of a model.
perspectives:
Perspectives can be used in stories.
By default, you see your object’s business name.
If you want to see the technical name instead of the business name, choose Your user iconSettingsUI SettingsShow Technical Name .
You can use the following functions:
Search for Objects

Partition Your Data
Break your data down into smaller and more manageable parts by creating partitions on columns of your dataset.
Larger data volumes can cause replication runs to terminate because of memory shortage.
To avoid such situations, you can break your data down into smaller and more manageable parts.
From this menu, you can create new partitions or edit or delete existing partitions.
To create partitions for your data, add the number of partitions you need:
Columns:
Select the column from which the partition will be defined.
Not all columns can be selected, because there are some restrictions.
For more information, see <locked-ref>.
Partitions:
Add the number of desired partitions by entering a range for each of them.
Ranges must not overlap
Partitioning requires an in-depth knowledge of the values that are used or are valid for the chosen partitioning column.
Negative values are not valid for partition bounds of numeric columns and will be converted to 0 at runtime.
The low bound must be lower than the high bound.
The order is checked according to the type of the partition column.
Example: for string-like columns, '90' <= DOC_ID < '100' is not valid, whereas '090' <= DOC_ID < '100' is valid.
Load a new snapshot of data to start the partitioning immediately, or alternatively create a schedule to load new snapshot later (or wait until you next schedule run will occur).
If your defined ranges don’t cover all the data, additional partitions are created in the background .
For example, if rows have been inserted or modified since your last snapshot and they now don’t match any of the defined ranges.
An additional partition called 'Others' is created to cover this data.
For more information, see <locked-ref>.

Intelligent Lookup Reusable Content
You should choose:
A column intended to identify individual objects of the type stored in the lookup table.
These columns often end in ID (such as a Product ID, Customer ID, or Building ID) or are some other kind of unique identifier, like Email Address.
If such a column does not exist, you may choose to create a calculated column and concatenate values from other columns into it to provide unique identifier values.
If the column does not exist and cannot be easily created, or if the objects in the input and lookup entities are of the same type, select the key column.

An association describes the relation between business entities.
The associated business entities will be available as dimensions when you create a consumption model.
Choose <locked-ref>Create.
Select your target business entity.
The information Referential Integrity Ensured is used for performance optimizations during querying.
If switched on, it indicates that each data record of the currently opened business entity finds a match in the selected target business entity with the configured key mapping.
If there is no match found for every data record but Referential Integrity Ensured is switched on, it can impact the result during querying.
Define which fields of the business entity shall function as keys:
Select a key offered by the target business entity via the drop-down menu.
Map the corresponding target key field to the corresponding field of the current business entity.
You get a message on the key mapping validation:
This provides you feedback on how many entries within the current business entity there are and how many of them match to entries of the target business entity.
This information shall help you evaluate whether the set configuration makes sense.
Via Association Context you can provide information on the context of the association within the business entity.
This allows for multiple associations between the same business entities (in different contexts) and provides additional business meaning to the association.
The context will be available as additional information on every usage of the association, e.g. in a consumption model.

Connect to your underlying <locked-ref> database with this user to analyze, diagnose and solve database issues.
The intent of this user is to support where ordinary database users lack the required privileges and, thus, should only be created when a specific task is required.
It's not intended to be used as a stand-by user and should be deleted after finishing the required task.
We strongly recommend creating this user with an automatic expiration date.
That way the user is no longer active after a set period of time.
This user can access all <locked-ref> monitoring views and all <locked-ref> meta data (read permission) and, thus, has access to all data in all spaces including all sensitive data.
It is, therefore, to be created with caution.
You require a DWC Administrator role to create this user.
Auditing
All actions of the database analysis user are audited.
The logs are saved as a new view called ANALYSIS_AUDIT_LOG and are stored in the space that has been assigned to store audit logs.
For detailed information please see Database Analysis User.
First Steps to Create Insights
There are many ways to collect and combine data to create business insights:
Create Views
Query data from one or more tables or other views.
Create Local Tables
Upload file data.
Create Entity-Relationship Diagrams
Acquire remote tables from your sources.
Visualize and create associations between your remote tables, local tables, and views.
Associations that you define in entity-relationship diagrams can help when building views by pre-configuring joins between your view sources.

Compute Blocks
A compute block provides vCPUs and 60 to 64 GB of RAM.
Select the number of compute blocks using the + and - buttons.
You can specify from 2 blocks (minimum), by increments of 1 block.
Each compute block provides a certain number of vCPUs and a range of 60 to 64 GB of RAM, depending on the hyperscaler.
The number for vCPUs and memory are calculated based on the compute blocks and you cannot directly modify them.
Dependencies between storage and compute blocks: the storage and compute blocks depend on each other.
When you modify a parameter, the other one needs to be changed accordingly.
The minimum and maximum allowed storage sizes depend on the total memory defined by the selected compute blocks.
The storage size must be higher than the memory size and can only be increased up to 4 times as much as the memory.
All the possible size combinations of storage and compute blocks are controlled.
When the size combination you enter is allowed, the sizes are kept.
When the size combination you enter is not allowed, error messages guide you to modify the sizes.
Consumed Storage
View the amounts of consumed data.
The bar shows the total amount of storage that is consumed in the database tenant.
Hover over the bar, a tooltip displays the consumed amounts for the following data:
data related to spaces,
data not related to spaces (for example: data consumed by audit logs or data consumed in schemas created by a database user group).
Audit logs can consume a large quantity of GB of disk.
You can delete audit logs when needed, which will free up disk space.

Create Statistics
Create statistics for your remote tables to improve federated query execution..
To ensure the best possible performance when accessing your remote tables and improve federated query execution, you can create statistics for your remote tables.
You can create three types of data statistics object:
RECORD COUNT:
Creates a data statistics object that helps the query optimizer calculate the number of records (rows) in a table data source.
The RECORD COUNT type is a table-wide statistic.
SIMPLE:
Creates a data statistics object that helps the query optimizer calculate basic statistics, such as min, max, null count, count, and distinct count.
HISTOGRAM:
Creates a data statistics object that helps the query optimizer estimate the data distribution.
Statistics are created for each column of the table and can only be created if the data access is "Remote".
Only one data statistics object at a time is allowed per remote table.
For more information, see <locked-ref>.
Modifying and Excluding Columns

Remote Queries
Monitor how the communication between SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and the connected remote source systems is running.
SAP Data Warehouse Cloud is connected to remote systems via SAP HANA Cloud using data federation.
SAP HANA Cloud already provides a corresponding monitoring view of actual SAP HANA runtime data, including statistics and status information related to the execution of Data Manipulation Language (DML) statements.
The Remote Query Monitor retrieves this information, so that you can keep an eye on how the communication between SAP Data Warehouse Cloud and the connected remote source systems is running and better analyze possibilities for performance bottlenecks while running queries in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud.
It displays the last 100 statements.
