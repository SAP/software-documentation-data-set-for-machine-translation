Determination and Validation
Implement custom logic to your custom business object.
After you have published your custom business object, you can use the following patterns to add custom logic to your custom business object:
After modification
This pattern is used to recalculate data immediately after node instances have been created or edited, and then saved.
Logic of this pattern overwrites field values such as text strings or dates.
Before Save
This pattern is used to validate the consistency of node instances in the save phase.
Logic of this pattern checks field values for correctness and displays error messages if field values are incorrect.
RUC_CONF_FIN_CM_CINGACCOUNTSFORRECEIVING
Clearing accounts track open transactions that require additional transactions to form a complete business process.
When you transfer money from one house bank account to another, the system is not directly posting a debit to the receiving house bank account.
Instead, it temporarily posts a debit to a clearing account that is assigned to the receiving house bank account.
The offsetting credit entry is posted to another clearing account that is predefined in your chart of accounts.
This credit entry is posted as soon as you create a payment request to transfer money to the receiving house bank account.
When the incoming amount appears on the bank statement of the receiving house bank account, the bank statement processing finally posts a debit to the receiving house bank account and a credit to the clearing account.
This posting completes the transfer on the receiving side.
You can specify the clearing accounts for incoming bank transfers based on company code, house bank, payment method, currency, and house bank account.
If you do not specify a currency, the clearing account is used for all currencies.
Requested Resource
This is the resource requested by the project manager.
This is the project manager's candidate of choice.
Project managers can request a specific resource when adding a role to a work package.
If they do, the delivery organization of the requested resource is added automatically to the resource request.
If a resource has been requested and the request has not yet been staffed, you'll see a Quick Assignment link in the Actions column.
This allows you to create the assignment exactly as requested by the project manager.

Consumption views are customized basic and composite views dedicated for actual consumers addressing specific requirements.
Enter Temporary Adjustment
Adjust the recognized cost of sales or recognized revenue
Allows you to adjust the recognized cost of sales or recognized revenue amount manually.
Adjustments are overwritten by the next revaluation, that is, with either of the following:
The Revalue function in this app
A periodic revenue recognition run executed with the Run Revenue Recognition - Projects app
The revaluation function generates a source document.
Save as New Version
Use this function to create a new version of the context.
You use this function to create a new version of the context.
A new version of a context can only be created if it is assigned to at least one legal transaction and a major change is applied, such as adding a category.
If you choose Save as New Version and the context is not yet assigned to a legal transaction, an error message informs you to use Save instead.
If you save a new version, a dialog asks you to set a status for the new version.
You can set the status to either Ready or Active.
If you set the status to Active, the system sets the status of the previous version to Replaced and the connection between the two versions is indicated by the Replaced By and Previous Version fields in the general data of the context.
The legal transaction keeps the context version that was originally assigned.
The new version can only be assigned to new legal transactions.
Suitable Resources
These resources are proposed based on suitability matching results.
This tab shows suitable resources based on suitability matching results.
You can do the following:
View more detailed information for a specific resource by clicking the relevant table row
Select a resource to be assigned to the request

Make sure that you only select resources that are not yet assigned to the request.
Change the assignment for resources that are already assigned to the request
If a resource is already assigned to the request, you'll see a blue vertical bar.
To change the assignment, you create a new assignment for the resource:
If the new assignment is for the same period as the current assignment, the current assignment is automatically deleted and replaced with the new one.
If the new assignment is for a different period (in the request time frame), the new assignment is added to the existing assignment.
Want More Information?
To learn more about suitability matching, see the product assistance for SAP S/4HANA Cloud:
Decoupled Lead Time
Displays the decoupled lead time
Displays the decoupled lead time (DLT).
DLT is a sum of the longest lead times of non-buffered products in a sequence headed by a buffered (DD-relevant) product in a BOM, adding up to a cumulative lead time for the buffered product.
The current and proposed lead times are displayed in days.
The change in decoupled lead time is the percentage difference between the proposed and the current decoupled lead times.
In case you have never generated a buffer proposal for the products you have selected, an up-to-date decoupled lead time (DLT) is mandatory for generating a new buffer proposal.
The DLT is automatically calculated, unless you have specifically chosen not calculate it, in which case the buffer proposals for those products will not be generated.
Display Job
Specifies which jobs are to be displayed in the job list
You can choose one of the following values from the dropdown list to specify which jobs are to be displayed in the job list:
Mine only
The list displays only the jobs to which your personnel number is assigned.
My team's only
The list displays only the jobs to which other employees of your workcenter are assigned.
Jobs to which you are assigned are not displayed.
Mine and my team's
The list displays all the jobs to which other employees of your workcenter or you are assigned.
To be assigned in my team
The list displays all the jobs of your workcenter that have not yet been assigned to an employee.
Arrears for Clearing
Calculates days in arrears for clearing.
Calculate days in arrears for clearing.
If you select this parameter, days in arrears are calculated for items that were cleared after the key date for the days in arrears calculation.
The items are then also included when the due items and sorted lists are determined.
No days in arrears are calculated for items that were cleared before the key date of the days in arrears calculation.
For example, if this parameter is selected, an item that was 20 days overdue on January 31 but cleared on February 2, will appear among due items in a correspondence document created on February 3.
If this parameter is not selected, the item is no longer considered due, as it was cleared before February 3.
Force Update of Collection Specialist
Activate to overwrite the collection specialist for all business partners in the selected collection segment.
If the indicator is set:
You can overwrite the collection specialist in the collection segment selected.
You can remove the existing collection specialist from the collection segment selected by leaving the Collection Specialist field empty.
If the indicator is not set:
The existing collection specialist is retained if possible.
If the collection specialist is not assigned to the collection group, the collection specialist is initialized in this case.
Availability (Total Hours)
This value is calculated based on the total number of required and free hours.
This availability match percentage is calculated based on the total number of hours that a resource is free in the request time frame and the total hours required by the resource request.
If the request has not yet been staffed, the match percentage is calculated as follows:
Availability Match % = (Free Hours / Required Hours) * 100
If the request has been staffed for fewer than the required number of hours, the match percentage is calculated as follows:
Availability Match % = (Free Hours / Remaining Required Hours) * 100
If the number of free hours exceeds the number of required hours, the availability match percentage is 100%.
By default, the app uses this match percentage to calculate the total suitability match.
In the filter settings, you can specify that the monthly distribution of required hours and free hours is used instead.
Communication Status
Shows if communication has been made for a matching item.
Shows what communication means and content have been made for the matching item.
The following communication statuses are available:
Not Started:
No communication yet.
Note Added:
A public note was added.
Notification Sent:
A notification was sent to someone for clarifications.
The recipients receive the notification in the header bar of the SAP Fiori launchpad ( icon).
Since communication activities are in chronological order, only the latest communication status is shown in the list.
However, you can view the communication history by choosing the status.

Supervisor Record Learning Work Area
Supervisors can use this information to record course completion for users.
Supervisors can record learning for their employees in the My Employees tab.
You record learning when the system cannot do it by itself: for example, when your employee completed an external event or completed a classroom course.
When you click Record Learning the record learning wizard opens.
Audit Data
When you record a learning event, the system collects data for an audit trail.
When your organization or the employee is audited for learning history, the data you enter can be part of the audit.
Course Scheduling Records
This topic describes the default and recommended use of the learning completion data.
This data is important to create an audit trail of your users' learning.
This topic contains the default, recommended usage of completion data for auditing purposes.
Your organization might use the data differently.
Course Schedule Data for Audits
Data Name
Audit Trail Application
Completion Date and Time
In audit reports, the completion date and time is when the user completed the learning.
When you record learning for a user, the completion date and time must be in the past because the user must have already completed the item before you record the event.
If the system knows the completion time, it populates the date and time for you.
Completion Time Zone
The system uses the time zone to be specific about the completion date and time.
Select the time zone that matches the users' completion.
Instructor Information
The instructors' name or ID identifies the instructor teaching the course.
If more than one instructor taught the course, choose the primary instructor.
Default Grade
The default grade is a flexible way to record a users' performance in a course.
Use your organizations' system for grading (letters, percentages, or numbers, for example).
Register/Withdraw Employees Work Area
This topic describes how supervisors can register and withdraw users from courses.
As a supervisor, you interact directly with your team of employees most often, and you are better positioned to understand what scheduled offerings a particular employee needs or doesn't need.
Therefore, you can use the Registration wizard to manage those needs by withdrawing or registering users for scheduled offerings.
You can only enroll or withdraw users from scheduled offerings that have not yet started.
When you register a user, you can enter comments about registering the user.
For example, you might want to inform the instructor of any special needs or circumstances about a user you have registered.
Administrators can access your comments by viewing the scheduled offering record; end users never see your comments.
Approvals Work Area
Use this information to manage your standard approval process in the Approvals work area.
When you use the standard approval process, each request for training can be approved or denied.
If you are requesting approval for training, use the approvals work area to monitor your requests.
If you approve requests for training, use the approvals work area to make the approval or to deny the request.
You can monitor or approve the following types of training requests in the Approvals work area:
External Requests: approval to attend an external training event
Internal Requests: approval to attend an internal training event
E-Signature (Electronic Signature) Verification:
An approval step that requires you to enter your e-signature code
Default Learning Reports
The reports available to you can vary depending on the configuration of your system.
These reports are available by default.
When you run a report, the system consolidates information from a variety of areas into a single report, which allows you to perform a targeted analysis of key data.
This table contains only learning reports, not legacy reports.
Report Name
Purpose
Active Goals
The purpose of the Active Goals report is to show all active goals.
Active goals are all goals that are on a user’s approved plans, including any plans that have expired.
While you can use the Active Goals report for a single user and a single approved plan, you get the most from the Active Goals report by consolidating active goals from multiple users or multiple plans into a single report.
You can group the report by the name of the goal or by the name of the user.
The report shows the goal name, description, goal type, target date, priority, category, weight (the report shows “N/A” for development or personal goals), status, and percent toward target.
As a user without subordinates, you can use the Active Goals report to consolidate the goals from your approved plans into a single report, giving you a progress report for your active goals and associated activities.
As a user with subordinates, you can use the Active Goals Report as progress report that shows the active goals for each subordinate’s approved plans.
Close-Fit Jobs
You can use the Close-Fit Jobs report to see which job positions are most suitable for your employees and to identify subordinates who are qualified, overqualified, or underqualified for their current job or for a job that might open soon.
If you identify employees who are overqualified for their current job positions, then you can promote them to other job positions that fit more closely with their competencies.
If you identify employees who are underqualified for their current job positions, then you can reassign them to other job positions that fit more closely with their competencies.
In a Close-Fit Jobs report, you can assess an employee’s qualification level for a job position by using the cumulative competency gap.
The cumulative competency gap equals the sum of all competency gaps (for competencies associated with the job position) divided by the number of competencies associated with the job position.
The cumulative competency gap can be positive, zero, or negative.
Users have a positive cumulative competency gap if and only if they have a positive competency gap for every competency associated with the job position.
Generally, a positive cumulative competency gap identifies users as overqualified for the job position.
Users have a negative cumulative competency gap when they have at least one competency rating that is below the required competency rating.
When users have both positive and negative competency gaps, the report changes the positive competency gaps to zero so that the cumulative competency gap will still be negative.
That is, even though a user might have a strength (positive competency gap) for most of the competencies associated with the job position, the user doesn’t meet all of the competency requirement levels for the job position; therefore, the report must show a negative cumulative competency gap for that job position.
Generally, a negative cumulative competency gap identifies users as underqualified for the job position.
The summary section of the report shows the strengths (the average peer rating is greater than the user’s self rating) for each user while the details section of the report lists the close-fit job positions, the cumulative gap, and the competency with the largest gap, including the value of the gap (the gap equals the peer rating minus the user rating).
If users have not been evaluated for a competency associated with a job position, then the report treats the competency rating as zero.
A zero rating on any competency causes the greatest competency gap and the greatest cumulative competency gap.
Therefore, when you assess a user’s close-fit job report, be sure to account for unrated competencies.
Competency Assessment Comparison
You can use the Competency Assessment Comparison report to compare the competency ratings for a user with the organization average and the company average.
If a user is assigned a competency, but has not yet been rated for that competency, then the report excludes that user for that competency.
Competency Assessment Trend
Supervisors use the Competency Assessment Trend report to see if the competency ratings of their direct reports have improved or declined over time.
Each user could have up to five competency ratings for each competency.
For example, if you select 3 Months from the Historical Trend Interval list, then the first (most recent) competency rating appears in the Current Rating column; the second competency rating appears in the Last Rating column; and the third, fourth, and fifth competency ratings appear in the Historical Trend column.
Curriculum Status
As a supervisor, you can use the Curriculum Status report to review which users have fallen behind on completing their assigned curricula.
Employee Dropoff
You can use the Employee Dropoff report to show users whose supervisor rating has fallen significantly from the previous review to the most recently published review (you define the significance of the dropoff using Gap Threshold).
To be included in the report, the user must have more than one review, and the most recent supervisor rating must be lower than the previous supervisor rating.
Employee/Supervisor Ratings Gap
You can use Employee/Supervisor Ratings Gap report to show users whose self rating was significantly different from their supervisor’s rating (you define the significance of the gap using Gap Threshold).
The gap can be positive or negative: the supervisor can have the higher or the lower rating of the two.
The report shows all gaps from the most recent performance review.
Item Requests
As a supervisor or learning coordinator, you can use the Item Requests report to identify which items might require an additional scheduled offering to meet current demands or needs.
Item Status
You can run the Item Status report to show the completion dates and statuses for items in the learning history.
Learning History
As a supervisor, you can use the Learning History report to list all of the items that your direct or indirect reports have completed.
You can use this report to compare each user’s performance and their status for the item.
Learning Hours
You can run the Learning Hours report to display the details for events in the user learning history that include course length, credit hours, CPE hours, and contact hours.
Learning Needs
You can run the Learning Needs report to view the assigned items that remain on a user’s to-do list.
This report can be filtered to show only required learning.
Learning Plan
You can run the Learning Plan report to display all of the items a user has been assigned.
This report includes completion dates where applicable, and it can be filtered to show only learning needs or required assignments.
Tuition
The Tuition report displays the amount the user paid in order to launch, register, or complete an item.
User Information
The User Information report shows basic information about each user.
You can use this report, for example, to troubleshoot some common issues, such as ensuring that users have email addresses when they say that they are not receiving email notifications.
Learning Assignments and Learning History
Your learning assignments are courses you need to complete and your learning history is the list of courses you have already completed.
This topic describes the two lists.
Your learning assignments list includes all work you need to do, including learning items, scheduled offerings, and curricula.
It is the central place for your assignments.
Your learning history is a record of the work that you completed.
When you finish a course, it moves from the learning assignments list to the learning history list.
Completing a Task Checklist Evaluation
A task checklist is a type of exam where an observer watches a participant complete a task and marks off the steps in a checklist.
This topic describes how you complete the checklist.
About Task Checklists
A task checklist contains all of the tasks that users should be able to complete as a result of successfully learning the content of a learning item.
As a user, a task checklist allows you to demonstrate your mastery of an item by demonstrating that you can complete each task that is associated with the item.
If your administrator enabled a task checklist for an item, then the system places the item on your assignments list with a Request Observation action.
You can also request an observation by viewing the item details for the item.
Nominating an Observer
If you are assigned a task checklist, your first step is to nominate other users to observe you complete the task.
The observer's job is to watch you complete the task and to fill out a checklist that shows you completing each step in the task.
To nominate a user, click Request Observation.
You can search for and add any number of observers but only one observer can submit the results.
You can continue to add or remove observers until an observer submits your task checklist with a completion status.
When you add or remove an observer, the system places the item on the observer's assignment list with an Open Observation action.
The observer can also launch the task checklist from the item details page.
Completing a Task Checklist
To complete a task checklist, open the checklist (click Open Observation).
For each task in the list, silently read the task description and check the correct completion status.
If you observe the person completing the task, mark the task complete.
If not, mark it incomplete.
You can also add comments for each individual task or for the entire checklist of tasks.
When the observation is over, you can record completion or record failure.
In some situations, you could have task status of incorrect but still click Record Completion for the entire task checklist.
Likewise, there are situations where you might have a task status of correct for all tasks but still click Record Failure for the entire task checklist.
Your company or supervisor should provide guidance on the standards to use to determine completion or failure for a task checklist.
Offline Learning
There are two ways to view content when you are not connected to the internet: legacy Plateau Offline and Mobile Learning.
This topic describes the difference between the two.
Mobile Offline
Mobile Learning downloads learning assignments to your mobile device, where you can view content (videos, web pages, and so on).
Your learning administrator can restrict the content that can be downloaded to Mobile Learning.
Download the mobile app from your app store.
Legacy Plateau Offline
You can download learning content and legacy Plateau assessments to Plateau Offline, which is a Windows application.
After you download them, you can disconnect from your network and work on them.
Because Plateau Offline works disconnected, it is ideal for users who travel with a laptop or who have a slow network connection or who need offline access to Plateau Assessments.
Plateau Offline tracks the content objects you complete while you are offline.
When you log back in to the user interface, the system synchronizes with Plateau Offline.
The system locks Plateau assessments that you download.
If you attempt to download the assessment again, you see a warning that you can lose your work.
Earning Credit for Courses
offers you more than one way to earn credit.
This topic describes how the system assesses your progress.
As you progress through your learning assignments, the system stops from time to time to assess your progress in your learning goals and it offers several ways to earn credit:
Some courses grant credit when you start and complete them.
Some courses grant credit when you pass an exam.
A few courses have alternative ways of assessing your skills and knowledge:
Task checklists are a special type of exam: an observer watches you complete a task and indicates that you completed the steps in the task and that you were successful.
Some users, like administrators, can assign credit directly through the record learning process.
External Requests Work Area
The external request work area is for organizations that require that you complete an electronic form as part of an approval process for external training: training that is outside of your organization.
For example, United States Federal customers to use a form called "SF-182" to request external training.
provides a work area for external requests at Home Links External Requests..
In the work area, you can:
Complete and submit an online form requesting external courses
View forms that have been sent to you for approval, and then approve or deny the request with a reason
External Request (SF-182) Workflow
The phrase "External Request" can be confusing.
The workflow uses the phrase even after a request has been approved.
A request can have multiple phases, including approved.
Completing an External Request Form
Go to Home Links External Requests.
To open a blank form, click New Request.
To reuse a form, changing only the form fields that need to change, click Copy Request next to the form you want to copy.
After you complete the form, follow the workflow wizard to send the form for approval.
If you need help completing the form, click the Instructions link to open instructions on your particular form.
Approving or Denying Requests
When you have pending approval requests, you see an alert:
Home My Learning Assignments You have pending approval requests.
You can either click the alert or click Home Links Approvals to open the approvals work area.
You use the same approvals work area whether you are approving an external request, approving the verification of an external request, or approving some other kind of request, such as internal training.
In the approvals work area, go to Training External Training and then follow the workflow wizard to approve or deny the request.
Your organization might have multiple steps in the workflow, but at the end of the process, the request appears in the user's assignments list and the user's external request work area.
Identifying Upcoming External Training
To identify upcoming external training events, go to Home My Assignments Filter, and then select External Requests from the course types list.
Verifying an External Request
After you attend an event, you verify that you attended it.
To verify your attendance, go to Home Links External Requests.
Find the request that corresponds to your event and click Verify.
Follow the workflow wizard to complete verification.
After you verify your attendance, the event appears in your history.
In many cases, you can verify your attendance by yourself.
In some cases, an administrator must verify your attendance.

provides three approval processes.
In most cases, your organization uses only one or two processes.
Approval processes are managed from the Links tile.
Standard approval process:
The standard approval process is the most common.
Your organization creates an approval process with one or more steps.
You manage approvals in the Approvals workspace.
External requests process:
Most commonly used by United States Federal organizations, the external request process uses the standard federal SF-182 form to request external training.
You manage external requests in the External Requests workspace and also the Approvals workspace.
Training planner process:
The training planner is used by organizations that plan their training on a budget period like fiscal year and that have a top-down training approach.
You manage training planner approvals in the Training Planner workspace.
Other Links
Your organization can add links to the Links tile.
This topic explains why your organization might add a link.
Links are highly customizable.
For example, your company might add a link to its intranet in the Links tile, or it might remove the External Requests link if it isn't using the external requests process.
It is also possible that your organization uses Plateau legacy products:
Plateau Performance and Plateau Compensation.
If you use the legacy products, your links are very different from the Links tile.
See the Plateau legacy flash help for help with legacy products.
Using Available Offering Suggestions
The Available Offerings tile suggests courses that can help you meet requirements.
This topic helps you use the tile.
The Available Offerings tile suggests upcoming courses that help you complete part of a curriculum or complete single assignments on your My Learning Assignments list.

Training Planner Roles
Use this information to understand how you fit into the training planner process.
The primary users of the training planner are the training managers, who are responsible for budget approval, but all three roles must consider training needs, and their cost, over the planning time period.
If you are a training manager, your job is to keep your training plan on budget.
Use the workspace to consider your organization's training requests, and approve or deny the requests to stay in budget.
If you are a supervisor, your job is to consider the training needs of your team and submit the requests with their costs.
If you are an employee, your job is to consider your own training needs and submit them, with a cost, to the training manager.
How Requests From Users Roll up to the Training Manager
Assigning Alternate Supervisors
Use this topic to understand how and when you should assign a user to an alternate supervisor.
When users work for an extended period on projects that have them reporting to a different manager or supervisor, then you might want to transfer responsibility for completing the primary supervisor's tasks (for example, assigning or approving learning items) to an alternate supervisor.
When you click Manage Alternate Supervisors, you can identify other users as alternate supervisors and assign primary responsibility to them.
After you assign a user as an alternate supervisor, the system updates the My Employees area of the user interface for that alternate supervisor by including the user for whom they now have responsibility to complete a task.
The alternate supervisor can then proceed to complete the task or to identify another alternate supervisor for this user.
In the user interface, primary and alternate supervisors can assign any responsibility for tasks such that an alternate supervisor could reassign responsibility back to the primary supervisor; however, primary and alternate supervisors cannot remove an alternate supervisor who was included by an administrator.
Users (primary and alternate supervisors) can only remove the alternate supervisors that they have identified or the ones that their alternate supervisors have identified.
Furthermore, alternate supervisors cannot remove themselves from the list of alternate supervisors.
An administrator can remove any alternate supervisor.
Searching in Assign Learning Work Area
When you search in the assign learning work area, the search behaves a little differently than the Find Learning tile.
This topic explains how the search works in the assign learning work area.
In the assign learning work area, the system search is not case sensitive: searching for "ADMIN", "Admin", and "admin" returns the same results.
When you click Search, the system searches the title and description for your search criteria.
Therefore, the title for some of the search results will not match your search criteria.
For example, if you searched for "ADMIN" and the system found a title that is "Communicating Effectively," then the description for Communicating Effectively contains the search string that you specified (that is, it contains "ADMIN").
If you select Exact Phrase, then the system ignores capitalization and searches for the exact phrase, including spaces.
For example, if you select Exact Phrase and search for the keywords "ED AD", then the search results could contain "Advanced Administration Topics" (because the last two letters of "Advanced" and the first two letters of "Administration" are "ed ad").
If you clear Exact Phrase, then the system searches for the exact phrase and uses any spaces in the keywords differently.
If you have multiple keywords, then the system treats each word (as identified by a space) as a separate search.
The search results must contain all words, but the keywords can be in any order.
For example, if you clear Exact Phrase and search for the keywords "simul VANCE", then the search results could contain "Advanced Administrative Support Simulation" (because "simul" is contained in "Simulation" AND "VANCE" is contained in "Advanced").
If you select Search All Languages, then the system returns results from any locale.
To limit the search results to your preferred locale only, then you can clear the Search All Languages check box.
Finding External Content
View this section if you want to know about web courses.
Massive open online content (MOOC) includes leadership or programming language skills courses.
External content is available from partners.
The course catalogs from these partners must be enabled in the LMS by an administrator for the external content to be available in catalogs, grouped into learning systems like curricula, or directly assigned to users by administrators or supervisors.
To access external content, go to Home Find Learning Browse all courses Catalog Search Web Courses.
From Web Courses, you can view available external content, add a course to your assignments, or simply launch the course.
After the external content course is launched, click the course link that takes you to the partner website.
Keep in mind:
When you launch an external content course, you launch the provider's site to interact with the course outside.
You will need to log in to some external content course websites before accessing their external content.
Course completions are either self-completed or by certificates, which are determined by organization.
Selecting a Localized Page for Unauthenticated Users
All pages visible to authenticated users are translated into your language, based on your choice in Options and Settings, which the system reads when you log in.
If you are not yet logged in, however, you must tell the system your language.
When configured, you can select a locale for Login page display.
The locale list defaults to the browser locale if it matches an active locale; otherwise it is set to the system's default locale.
Localized pages include:
Login, Registration, Security Question and Answer, Forgot Username, and Forgot Password.
If you are a site user (if you do not need to log in to see your learning catalog and calendar of offerings, your pages are also translated through the Locales list.
My QuickGuides Work Area
View this section if you want to know about My QuickGuides.
Some users can create QuickGuides, which are step-by-step instructions that can quickly create with your phone or browser and then upload to your learning catalog for others to see.
If you are a user who can create QuickGuides, you can create a description that is searchable in the catalog and that is displayed when launching the guide.
For example, if your QuickGuide is entitled, "Forwarding Calls from your PC", your description could be, "This describes how to forward phone calls on your office phone when you need to look up the extension."
If your company gives you access to QuickGuides, you can bookmark them from search results or a launched guide.
You can access bookmarks from your home page in the Bookmarks tile.

Configuration data, such as planning levels and planning groups.
The program might check out that a planning level is used in other places, but this planning level does not exist.
Master data, such as bank accounts and house bank accounts.
The program might check out that a house bank account is used in other places, but this house bank account does not exist.
Transactional data, such as master data that are stored in One Exposure from Operations..
The program might check out that the bank account master data is not correct in One Exposure from Operations.
Depreciation Variant
Defines the depreciation type of the posted amount or planned amount.
Asset depreciations are planned and posted in different types.
Select a depreciation variant to report posted and planned amounts for one of the following depreciation types:
Ordinary Depreciation:
The value reduction caused by the wear and tear on the asset over the course of its expected useful life.
Unplanned Depreciation:
The unplanned value correction (caused for example by an accident) as the result of a reduction in asset value that appears to be permanent.
Special Depreciation:
The special value correction for tax reasons that is allowed in addition to ordinary depreciation.
Transfer of Reserves:
The posting of gain (resulting from an asset sale) to replacement assets, also called hidden reserves or undisclosed reserves.
According to tax legislation in certain countries, the gain from an asset sale reduces the acquisition and production costs of newly acquired assets.
The gain is treated as a value adjustment on the liabilites side to offset the acquisition and production costs.
Configuration App Details (Entry Page)
View the log of configuration activities and start the configuration app
With this app you get information about the self-service configuration app and you can view the log of configuration activities.

Edit Instruction Keys
Enables you to edit the instruction keys for individual payments.
With this function you can edit the instruction keys for individual payments within the batch.
You can select and edit multiple items at the same time, but only if all the selected items have the same bank country and payment method.
Instruction keys give information about how payments should be executed.
This usually relates to how bank charges are settled, but could also affect the urgency of the payment.
The instruction keys are defined in customizing, and the bank country and payment method will determine which instruction keys are available.
Bulk Material
Indicates direct access to a material component at the work center.
You can enter the bulk material indicator in the material master record and the BOM item.
If a material is defined as a bulk material, dependent requirements for this material are not relevant to MRP.
MRP for bulk materials is based on consumption.
Indicator in the material master record
You can define a material as a bulk material in the MRP data of the material master record.
If you set the bulk material indicator in the material master record, the system sets the bulk material in material master indicator in the BOM.
Indicator in the BOM
This indicator is only supported for items that are relevant to production or plant maintenance or both.
The item cannot be relevant to costing.
You cannot enter a production storage location for bulk materials.
The indicator in the material master overrides the indicator in the BOM item.
An indicator in the BOM item tells you whether the material is defined as a bulk material in the material master.
If a material is always used as a bulk material, set the bulk material indicator in the material master record.
If a material is only sometimes used as a bulk material, set the bulk material indicator in the BOM item.
If the BOM is only allocated to one plant, you see the default value from the material master record in this plant when you create an item.
Debit / Credit Material
Adjust the inventory value
Enables you to adjust the inventory value of the material.
Enter the posting date and a header text for the material document.
For all currency types, specify the revaluation amount and the reference quantity for which the costs are to be posted.
Depending on the price control, the revaluation amounts are posted to a price difference account and/or to the material stock account:
For standard price materials (price control S), the revaluation amount is posted to a price difference account.
The standard price of the material is not changed.
For moving average price materials (price control V), the revaluation amount is posted to the material stock account unless stock coverage is insufficient.
If stock coverage is insufficient, only the portion for the available stock is posted to the stock account; the remainder is posted to a price difference account.
Example for Moving Average Price
A material with price control V has a base quantity of 100 units and an inventory quantity of 50 units.
The inventory value is EUR 500.
If you enter an adjustment of EUR 100, EUR 50 is posted to the material stock account and EUR 50 is posted to the price difference account.
Create New Strategy

Aging Status
Displays the status of the selected data aging object.
A data aging object can have the following statuses:
Enabled - Aging Started:
Shows that the object is active and the aging run is scheduled for the selected data aging object.
Enabled - Aging Not Started:
Shows that the object will be activated automatically during the next scheduled data aging run for this object and the aging run is not scheduled for the selected data aging object.
Not Enabled:
Indicates that the selected data aging object is inactive and cannot be used in an aging run.
Use Dynamic Parameters
Expose single value filters and parameters also as URL parameters.
Select this checkbox to define that all single value filters and parameters from the context are also exposed as URL parameters.
In this case, each property of the context that has a single value only is exposed as key-value pair in the URL.
This includes global filters set in the filter bar, selections in analysis steps, and filters and parameters handed over to APF from another application.
This is useful, for example, if the navigation target is unable to consume a context from the app state or if the intent of the navigation target has mandatory parameters that must be provided as URL parameters.
Dynamic parameters occur in the URL of the called application.
Therefore, data protection and privacy aspects have to be considered.
By default, this checkbox is not selected.
In this case, the application context is handed over to the navigation target using an app state.
Reference Key
Enter additional information you need for subsequent processing.
In the Reference Key fields, you can enter customer/supplier details for the accounting transaction.
Enter the customer/supplier details which you need for subsequent processing according to your individual company's regulations.

For correspondence with the customer/supplier
As a search criterion for items in the customer/supplier account
Possible entries could be as follows:
Customer/supplier branch number
Transaction number under which a controversial transaction is managed at the customer/supplier
Duplicated
Lists the uploaded items whose IDs are identical with the existing items in the target system.
Lists the rules, methods, and selections that are uploaded from the spreadsheet and have IDs identical with the existing ones in your current system.
The existing items may have the Active, Draft, or Inactive status.
Therefore, you need to compare the duplicates and decide if you want to skip the uploaded items or to import them so that the existing items are overwritten.
If you choose to import the duplicated items anyway, only the draft version of existing items are overwritten because all the imported items have an initial status Draft.
However, the subsequent Mass Activation action can activate these imported items and overwrite the existing active rules, methods, or selections.

Some of the notification preferences that you set affect all types of notifications, while others are specific to a notification type.
For further information, see.
Deactivated/Archivable
Assets that have been removed from your asset portfolio.
Assets are deactivated and the deactivation date is stored when they are removed from your company’s asset portfolio.
This may happen in one of several ways, for example, by being scrapped or sold.
Regardless of whether or not revenue is generated by the removal of an asset from the portfolio, from a bookkeeping perspective, it is recorded as a deactivation.
Assets may not be active and deactivated at the same time.
If a fixed asset is scrapped or sold, the system automatically assigns a deactivation date to the asset as a result of the deactivation posting.
By default, deactivated assets remain in the database, but it is possible to delete deactivated assets without postings, and to archive assets that have been deactivated for more than one year.
Top-Level Materials
Shows the capacity consumption of the top-level materials of the work center.
You can see how each top-level material contributes to the capacity consumption of the work center.
If there is a capacity issue, you have the possibility to shift the capacity demand to an earlier point in time.
Check, if this mitigates the capacity issue and click Shift Top-Level Demand.
Then check if the proposal is acceptable.
From the top-level material you can navigate to the Multi-Level Material Simulation, a structured view of the bill of material, and make simulations on material component level.
For example, you can change the source of supply or you have the possibility to preproduce a component.
Shipping Duration
The shipping duration chart displays the status of the goods receipt process and is a comparison of different times.
The shipping duration chart displays the status of the goods receipt process and is a comparison of different times: it shows today’s status of a material item in comparison to the forecast delivery date, for example when transit time exceeds the forecast delivery date the bar will appear in red.
The shipping duration chart displays the following information in detail:
Days in Transit:
Today's date (system date) or value of the field Days since Posting Date
Forecast Delivery Duration:
Time in days from purchase order (PO) creation to either predicted date or planned delivery date
Different from Assigned
Different liquidity items from the manually assigned ones.
You have two options for this field.
If you select yes, liquidity items that are different will then be displayed.
If you select no, the same liquidity items will be displayed.
If there's no selection, all the liquidity items are displayed, regardless of the difference.
By default, Yes is selected for this field, which means that cash flows whose actual liquidity item are different from the ones proposed by the machine learning service are displayed.
Add Missing Items
Add dependent items to collection.
If you want to export items that have dependencies to other items, you can click Add Missing Items to add all dependent items to your software collection.
If you want to know in detail what items are dependent on each other, click Check.

Post Goods Issue
Creates a goods issue when goods are moved from the plant after taking delivery.
When you post a goods issue for an outbound delivery, the following functions are carried out on the basis of the goods issue document:
1.
Warehouse stock of the material is reduced by the delivery quantity
2.
Value changes are posted to the balance sheet account, in inventory accounting
3.
Requirements are reduced by the delivery quantity
4.
Posting the goods issue is automatically recorded in the document flow
Skills Match
See to what extent the resource's skills match the required skills.
The skills match percentage tells you to what extent a resource's skills match the required skills that are specified in the resource request.
Skills are created as text-based tags in the employee fact sheet (for a resource) and in the project role (for a resource request).
The skills match is calculated by comparing text strings.
If multiple skills are specified in the resource request, the match percentage depends on how many of the required skills can be provided by the resource.
The more similar the strings are, the higher the match percentage.
If a skill contains spelling errors, the skills match still shows results, although with a lower match percentage.
If no skills are specified in the resource request, the skills match percentage is 100%.
In the filter settings, you can specify whether skills matching is based exclusively on a resource's skills, that is, the skills entered in the employee fact sheet, or whether to include the skills required in other requests to which a resource was or is assigned.
This is useful, for example, if the employee fact sheet does not contain any skills or if the skills specified there are not up-to-date.
Enter Temporary Adjustment
Adjust the recognized cost of sales or recognized revenue
Allows you to adjust the recognized cost of sales or recognized revenue amount manually.
Adjustments are overwritten by the next revaluation, that is, with either of the following:
The Revalue function in this app
A periodic revenue recognition run executed with the Run Revenue Recognition - Sales Orders app
The revaluation function generates a source document
Display Group
For displaying subtotals of the two sides.
A display group is comprised of two sides, typically the leading unit side and partner unit side.
Each side sums up the amounts of a sub-dataset.
The display group can be used to display the subtotals in the reconciliation overview and balance detail reports.
For example, you can define a display group that has two sides:
Accounts payable (AP) of the leading unit (company) and accounts receivable (AR) of the partner unit (trading partner company).
Maintain Restrictions
Maintain restrictions for value help, read, and write access.
You can restrict the authorizations included in a business role so that users can only view and edit a subset of all existing objects.
The restrictions allow you to differentiate your business roles on a fine-granular level.
When you define for a business role that a certain object should not be visible or editable, this applies to all apps included in this role.
You create two roles which both provide authorizations to work with billing documents.
Then you restrict the authorizations so that one role allows to edit billing documents for the sales organization A, and the other role enables users to edit documents for the sales organization B.
Delivery Completed
Displays the status of the goods receipt process on material items level.
Displays the status of the goods receipt process on material items level:
Yes:
The goods receipt process is completed
No:
The goods receipt process is still open
This field is the ideal filter criterion to identify purchase orders with overdue materials.
Global CoCode
This field is used for the following purposes:
Company codes which are involved in document entry for external SAP systems (ICT) as the sender or receiver.
This type of company code must have a cross-system company code ID (such as EUROPA) in addition to their local company code ID (such as 0001).
Company codes that are set up for ALE distribution scenarios.
When sending an IDoc with company code-dependent data, the company code is replaced with the cross-system company code in all company code fields.
When receiving this kind of IDoc, the reverse conversion takes place on the target system.
The cross company code can be a maximum of 6 characters long and is alphanumeric.
Posting Type
Types of postings (line items) to include.
You can choose which kinds of postings (line items) you would like to display:
All – All postings.
Actual – Only unrecognized postings that reflect actual costs inferred through business operations such as invoicing, taxing, and other.
Recognized – Only postings that are determined as recognized using the event-based revenue recognition model.
To learn more about event-based revenue recognition, see.
Opening Stock
Choose how the opening stock should be calculated to consider it for simulation.
This indicator determines how opening stock is to be calculated.
0 =
No opening stock
Simulative planning starts with no opening stock.
1 =
Safety stock as opening stock
The system reads the safety stock that is entered in the material master record.
2 =
Plant stock at time of transfer (current date)
The system reads the current plant stock that is valid at the time of scheduling.
3 =
Plant stock at start date of reference
The projected plant stock can be calculated from the current stock- or requirements situation for the start date of the reference object.
Product Allocation Objects
Lists product allocation objects.
The Product Allocation Objects subscreen lists product allocation objects.
Standard functions are available for creating, displaying, changing and deleting product allocation objects.
To display general information about the product allocation objects and its characteristics or to change a product allocation object, click on the corresponding entry in the list.
You can delete a product allocation object by selecting an entry in the list and choosing Delete.
Note that product allocations with consumed quantity are not deleted from the database: their lifecycle status will be set to Obsolete.
Product allocation objects without consumed quantity are deleted from the database.
Add Counter, Restricted/Calculated/Converted Measure
This option allows you to define a restricted, calculated, or converted measure in the corresponding data source.
Restricted Measure:
Use Restricted Measure to define a field that is filtered based on a specific condition.
By applying the restricted measure to a field, you generate a result set for comparative analysis of data.
Calculated Measures:
Use Calculated Measure to convert from one unit of measure to another.
Choose “Edit” to define the conversion logic.
The editor provides you with elements, operators, and predefined analytical functions to define an expression.
Converted Meaures:
Use Converted Measure to convert unit or currency measures from one value to another.
Counter:

The list of dimensions may vary based on the data source it is derived from.
Procurement Type
You can use this to filter your products based on their procurement type
You can use this to filter your products based on their procurement type.
With Demand-Driven Replenishment, the procurement type for products that are
produced in-house is Make
procured from external sources is Buy
transferred in through STOs is Transfer
If the procurement type for a product is not maintained, it will appear as Missing.
Release Planned Price Changes
Sets future prices to the standard price
When you release planned price changes, the valid future prices become the current standard price of the materials in the relevant currencies and valuations.
The planned prices must exist in the material master and they must be valid based on the validity date.
If no valid planned prices exist, the materials will continue to be valued with the valuation price used up to this point.
If the price determination indicator in the material master is set to 3 (Single-/Multilevel), the following prerequisites must be fulfilled:
The status of the material ledger data for the current period must be Period opened or Price change complete.
This means that there has been no goods movement, invoice, or order settlement posted for the material after period closing.
The closing entries for the previous period’s material price determination have not yet been made.
Thresholds
If you want errors to be issued whenever price changes exceed a certain threshold, select Consider Thresholds for Price Changes and adjust the percentages to the desired values.
Characteristic Value Combination
Creates a condition for filtering displayed data by specific CVCs.
You can use the Characteristic Value Combination field to select characteristics to be included or excluded from the filtered data displayed for analysis on the integrated cards.
By selecting the search button in the field, you are taken to the Define Conditions:
Characteristic Value Combination dialog where you can select the characteristics for filtering: the characteristics displayed here are the standard characteristic values that can be used when, for example, you configure product allocation objects.
Filtering by characteristic value combination impacts the data displayed on the integrated cards as follows:
The three cards for overloaded, underloaded and highloaded periods display data for periods belonging to the characteristic value combinations containing the specified characteristics or values.
The Characteristic Value Combinations card displays characteristic value combinations containing the specified characteristics or values.
The Product Allocation Order Items card displays only those order items with confirmation quantity assigned to a characteristic value combination containing the specified characteristic or values.
Fiscal Year and Fiscal Period
Only affect data shown in cards linked to asset balances.
The Fiscal Period and Fiscal Year filters only affect the data shown in the following cards:
Asset Balances
Asset Balances - Chart View
Asset Depreciation Values
Assets Under Construction
Depreciation to Be Posted
Origin of Assets
The data for the other cards is for the current fiscal period, or is selected in the card itself.
Change Future Prices with Reference
Change future prices based on a price type
Enables you to have future material prices changed automatically based on a selected price type, such as the future planned price or the standard price.
You can have the change become effective at the start of the next period, for the current period, or on a specific date.
When the specified time point is reached, the future price is changed to the price of the selected price type in all currencies and valuations in the material ledger data and in the company code currency in the material master.
Additional Factor
To account for anticipated price changes, you can enter an additional factor to be applied to the new future price.
For example, to increase the new future price by 10%, enter 1.1.
Upload File
Select a file to be uploaded as a legal document
You can use this function to upload a file, for example, a legal contract, to this legal document object.
While uploading, it is mandatory to select the content type, language, and the file to be uploaded.
By default, the content type and the langauge that you selected while working with the legal contexts, appear in the fields here.
However, you can change the langauge of the legal document now.
Based on your organizational process, you can either upload the required documents or leave it to the legal counsel to upload the document.
Preproduce
Select a row and click here to see when a material can be preproduced.
To reduce a capacity overload, you might be able to move the production of material components to an earlier point in time by using free slots for preproduction proposed by the system.
Proceed as follows:
Select the row of the component with an issue.
Click Preproduce.
Check the available slots for planning a preproduction.
The system proposes a capacity distribution.
Decide, if this is feasible.
Click Adopt Proposal, if you agree with the proposed distribution or enter a different distribution.
Click Apply.
Manage Subteams
Assign subteams
To assign or unassign subteams for a selected team, choose Manage Subteams and then use the YES or NO toggle button from the Assign Subteams list.
The list includes subteams that:
Belong to the same category as the parent team
Do not belong to another hierarchy
Have responsibility definition values that exactly match those of the parent team.
To prevent reassignment of existing subteams, a subteam's child teams are hidden from the view after a subteam is assigned to a parent team.
When you unassign a subteam, its child teams are shown in the view.
Copy Model/Reference Characteristic
Specifies how a master inspection characteristic can be used
You can use a master inspection characteristic, for example, in an inspection plan.
This field specifies, in which way the master inspection characteristic can be used.
The following options are available:
Reference Characteristic
If you use a master inspection characteristic specified as a reference characteristic, a reference is first created to this characteristic.
You can, however, cancel this reference and change the data individually (for example, tolerances).
Complete Copy Model or Incomplete Copy Model
For a master inspection characteristic specified as a complete or an incomplete copy model, the reference to this characteristic is canceled.
You can therefore immediately change the data (for example, tolerances).
Prioritizer
Defines the sort order of requirements.
In the Prioritizer subsection you can put sort attributes into a sequence, either by entering the sort attributes manually (possible entries are then suggested by the app) or, alternatively, by choosing the attributes in the Select:
Sort Attribute dialog.
You can use the standard sort functions to order the attributes and use Ascending and Descending to assign the sort direction.
Standard buttons are available for the following actions:
Adding a sort attribute
Removing selected sort attributes
Moving selected sort attributes to top or to bottom
Moving selected sort attributes up or down
Certain buttons are active for the above actions only when at least one sort attribute is selected and corresponding actions can be performed.
For an overview of the available sort attributes, see.
Selection Criteria
Defines basis for filtering requirements.
You can use the Selection Criteria field to define how you want to filter the list of requirements of the segment you are configuring.
The selection criteria is configured using a condition statement defined in the Requirement Filter.
Suggested values for the condition will appear while you type and the segment is saved as a draft version as soon as your cursor leaves the text field.
For example:
Entering Material will prompt the app to suggest Material of the ATP Document.
Entering is will prompt the app to suggest is equal to.
Entering Plant will prompt the app to suggest Plant of the ATP Document.
Ensure that you use encapsulate data values when creating the filter, for example, 'ATP01'.
To filter requirements for material ATP01 in plant 0001, you can configure your the condition as follows:
Material of the ATP Document is equal to 'ATP01' and Plant of the ATP Document is equal to '0001'.
UIs and Reports
The extensible UIs and reports for a selected business context
In addition to the details, you can navigate to the corresponding apps from:
UI Name - navigate to the SAP Fiori Apps Reference Library.
This is where you can find the details about a Fiori app
Custom Fields Added - navigate to the Custom Fields and Logic app.
This is where you can create or view details about custom fields
Publish
Finalize unpublished changes
Choose Publish to finalize the exclusion of fields, blocked data records, or the removal of excluded tables and fields before replication to the SAP Cloud Platform target system.
After you publish your changes in Exclude Fields and Records, you should also publish in Replicate CDS Views so that data is replicated based on your recent changes in Exclude Fields and Records.
The Publish button is available only to users that are authorized to replicate data.
If you exclude fields from a replicated view, a background job stops the delta replication in the target system after you publish in the Exclude Fields app.
This affects the last sync time for the replicated CDS view in the Replicate CDS Views app.
A regular midnight job compares the replicated views and tables that are excluded from replication.
The excluded tables are deleted from the target system and a new version of these tables is created in the target system.
The tables are then initialized without the excluded fields.
Delta replication continues to ensure near real time replication.
Dates Valid
Displays the timeframe for which this hierarchy is valid.
Please note that not all hierarchies require validity timeframes.
In these cases, this field displays N/A to indicate that the validity timeframe is not applicable for this hierarchy type.
For example, G/L account hierarchies and segment hierarchies do not require validity timeframes.
Both hierarchy types display N/A in this field.
Also, any hierarchies that you create using the Manage Custom Hierarchy Type app are non-time-dependent and display N/A here.
Agreement Type
Specifies the two types of scheduling agreements.
Specifies the two types of scheduling agreements, which are LP (Without release documentation) and LPA (With release documentation).
In LPA, all the scheduling lines are stored into the system and are not transmitted to the supplier.
Here, you have the advantage of changing the scheduling agreement as and when required.
In LP, no release for scheduling agreement is required.
In this case, schedule lines are immediately transmitted to the supplier the moment you save them.
Quality Information
The performance of the model version is evaluated using two main indicators.
The performance of the model version is evaluated using two main indicators: predictive power and the predictive confidence.
Predictive power is the quality indicator of a model version.
Predictive confidence is the robustness indicator of a model version.
The two values are combined into a quality star rating.
The star symbols are rated 1 to 5.
(One - five stars, with five stars indicating the best quality).
The Predictive Models app evaluates the quality of the model version, in terms of its predictive confidence and predictive power.
This quality indicator helps to decide whether or not to use the model version to make predictions.
Capacity Plan Simulation
Gives you an overview of the capacity situation of the work center.
In the Capacity Plan Simulation the capacity of the work center is displayed for the defined time period (bucket).
You can view all top-level materials of the work center.
The capacity issues are highlighted in red color.
Click a red-colored cell and use the inspector to understand and solve the capacity issue.
You can choose to increase the available capacity.
Check the share in consumption of each material before changing the available capacity and see, if the capacity situation improves.
Job Status
Status of background job
Indicates the current status of the background job.
The job status only applies to background jobs.
If no job status is shown, this is because the corresponding costing step is executed online.
In most cases the job status refers to the costing step corresponding to the costing run status.
Costing Run Status:
Marked
Job Status:
Finished
This means the background job has finished processing the Marking step.
Product Allocation Sequences
Lists product allocation sequences.
The Product Allocation Sequences subscreen lists all product allocation sequences or those that fulfill your specified search criteria.
By navigating to the next screen, you can display general information about the product allocation sequence and its sales sequence groups.
Standard functions are available for creating, displaying, changing and deleting product allocation sequences.
To display or change a product allocation sequence, click on the corresponding entry in the list.
Deleting a product allocation sequences ensures that the sequence is no longer listed on the Product Allocation Sequences subscreen but existing consumed quantity is not deleted.
The Allocation Sequence column contains an identifier (ID) for the product allocation sequence.
An ID for a product allocation sequence can be defined in two ways:
You can create an ID consisting of freely defined alphanumeric characters.
If a number range has been defined, a unique ID consisting of up to twenty characters is automatically assigned to each new product allocation sequence, as defined in the number range settings in your system.
Note that IDs generated in previous versions of the Assign Product to Product Allocation app may be listed (for example, S20170123094124.9785220) and can be renamed as required.
Orders for Completion
Displays confirmed orders that have not yet ben completed technically or for business
On the card Orders for Completion, you can analyze and monitor confirmed maintenance orders for which the end date lies within the chosen reference period but that have not yet been technically completed.
If you want to display all the confirmed orders in a list and complete them, click on the card.
The list displays, for example, the contact data of the person responsible.
You can display technical objects that have been assigned and branch to order processing.
You can also select orders directly in the list and complete them technically or for business by choosing the appropriate status in the pushbutton toolbar of the table.
If you click in the right-hand area, you can see the confirmed maintenance orders with the most important information displayed on cards in a carousel.
Here you can see, for example, whether there are outstanding purchase orders, outstanding services or outstanding reservations for the orders.
From the cards for the individual orders in the carousel, you can also branch to processing for the appropriate order or technically complete the order directly.
Auto Match
To run matching based on the rules in the current matching method.
Choose the button to run auto-match for your specified leading unit and partner units based on the method.
During the matching run, the Assign, Communicate, and Auto Match buttons are grayed out.
This is to prevent concurrent activities on the same data set and to avoid any data inconsistency.
Upon completion of the matching, the buttons are enabled again, and data refreshed.
For any existing assignment that has the reason code Temporary Resolution checkbox selected, the matching run unassigns and invalidates the assignment number, reads and rematches the latest data from the relevant data sources, refreshes the processing status, and triggers any follow-ups required by the reason code.
However, if the assignment is still in the process of automatic adjustment or approval workflow, the auto-match run skips it.
Processing Order
Sequence in which conditions are executed.
This is where you can define the sequence in which conditions are executed.
The more granular conditions (with more filters) always have to be executed before the more broadly defined conditions, which serve as a fallback.
Therefore, you can also create only one condition that does not have any filters.
This condition has to be the last one on the list.
As condition number 1 in the sequence of conditions, you define plant A in country B to trigger the situation instance.
As condition 2, you define plant B from country B.
As condition 3, you define no plant but country B.
Inspection Control
Identifies in the quality info record whether an inspection lot is created.
The following settings are available:
Inspection Active If Supplier Not Certified
An inspection lot is created if the settings in the material master require this, and if there is no other overriding control function.
No Inspection
No inspection lot is created, although the material master requires an inspection.
Inspection Active Regardless of Supplier Certification
An inspection lot is always created.
Materials with Invalid Source
Shows total number of materials with invalid source of supply.
You can see, if and how many materials have an invalid source of supply.
You can check the material with no valid source of supply in the Demand Plan Simulation and Multi-Level Material Simulation views.
Click an issue.
Then check under Issues the issue category No Valid Source and view more details about the specific material with no valid source of supply.
For example, you can see in which week or month the source of supply is missing and procurement won't be possible.
BOP Segment Definition
Display and edit selection criteria for segments.
You can use the BOP Segment Definition screen to define new and edit existing segments.
In doing so, you can define selection criteria and add sort attributes with which you can prioritize requirements.
The segments you define here are used to configure variants in the Configure BOP Variant app, after the segments have been activated by pressing the Activate button.
The BOP Segment Definition screen is structured as follows:
You can give a segment a meaningful name (mandatory) and description (optional).
You can use the Selection Criteria section to display and edit the filter criteria for your list of requirements.
By entering, for example, ATP, the app proposes relevant selection criteria automatically, for example, ATP Category of the ATP Document.
You can use the Prioritizer section to edit sort attributes and their sort order (Ascending or Descending) for your list of requirements.
Certain actions are only possible when the BOP Segment Definition screen is in display or in edit mode:
Activated segments are displayed when the BOP Segment Definition screen is in display mode.
You can edit, delete or copy an activated segment.
Segments with Draft status are shown when the BOP Segment Definition screen is in edit mode.
You can activate a segment or cancel any changes made previously.
You cannot edit or delete a segment if the segment is locked by another user.
Note that segment names can only contain a maximum of thirty characters, consisting of letters, digits and underscores - no other characters are permitted.
Revalue
Recalculates the values for the element.
Recalculates the values if you changed for example the planned cost.
You can simulate the revaluation before posting.
Recalculated values are color-highlighted.
Note that simply changing the planned cost has no effect on the revenue recognition values.
You have to trigger an update with this function.
Demand Plan Simulation
Shows the demand quantities per bucket.
The Demand Plan Simulation displays a table with all planned independent requirements for a specific material per bucket (month or week).
To change the demand quantity, click a cell of the column showing the demand quantities of the simulation plan.
The red-colored cells indicate a capacity issue.
Click such a cell, to see more details about the issue.
Quantities Displayed
Reference/ Simulation
You can display the reference quantity and the simulation quantity side by side.
The quantities are displayed per month or week.
The demand quantity based on the reference plan is shown to the left and the simulated quantities to the right.
You can change the simulated quantity.
Simulation Only
You can display only the simulated quantities that can be changed by you.
Delta of Reference and Simulation
You can display only the delta of the demand quantities based on the reference plan in comparison with the changed demand quantities of your simulation plan.
The focus of the Demand Plan Simulation view lies on demand quantities whereas the focus of the Capacity Plan Simulation view is on capacities of the work centers.
Check both focus views, to take the right decision.
Test Your Processes
Create and adapt test plans to test your business processes
Access the test app to check the correctness of the business processes which have been activated and configured using the app Manage Your Test Processes.
You can perform the following activities:

Authorization Relevant
Use this field to search for categories that are authorization relevant.
You can search for categories that are marked as authorization-relevant.
For these categories, authorizations checks determine whether a user is allowed to display, change, create, and / or update the respective category.
Categories without the Authorization Relevant flag are ignored in these authorization checks.
In order to be able to see a context or legal transaction, a user needs to have authorization for all categories that are defined for the context or the legal transaction.
If, for example, a legal transaction is assigned the "Top Secret", "ERP" and "Sales Department" categories, but a user is only authorized for "Top Secret" and "ERP" and not for "Sales Department", he will not be able to see the legal transaction.
Rating for Sec.
Class
The result of credit rating for a security class.
Indicates the result of a rating for a security class that is carried out by a credit rating agency.
You would like to display security classes with good credit ratings.
You therefore choose a rating agency, for example Moody's.
Then you choose the rating, for example, AAA.
Then you can see security classes with Moody's AAArating.
Upload
After maintaining the code values in the template, you can upload them to the app.
After maintaining the values in the template, you can upload your changes.
Make sure to save the template in CSV UTF-8.
No values will be overwritten, values will only be added to the list.
If you have maintained translations maintain the translation languages by clicking Translation Select Language.
You can either select all languages which you have maintained in the csv file or translate directly in the app.
Reverse
Reverse journal entries.
Reverses the selected journal entry.
You can also select multiple journal entries and reverse all of them simultaneously.
You generally post the reversal in the same period as the original journal entry.
If that period is closed, enter a posting date that falls within an open period.
Only journal entries created within Financial Accounting can be reversed.
You cannot reverse journal entries with source documents (such as goods issues or customer invoices) since these originate outside of Financial Accounting.
If you select a mixture of entries with and without a source document, only the entries without a source document are reversed.
The Reverse button is grayed out if you select only journal entries with a source document.
Reversing Intercompany Transactions
Intercompany transactions always involve two or more journal entries.
If you want to ensure that all journal entries for an intercompany transaction are reversed, select Process Intercompany Transactions Completely.
This reverses all journal entries involved in the intercompany transaction even if you didn’t select all of the entries.
If you don’t select Process Intercompany Transactions Completely, only the journal entries you selected are reversed.
Save
Use this function to save your changes.
You use this function to save the changes you have applied without creating a new version of the context.
Saving the changes is only possible in these cases:
If a context has not yet been assigned to a legal transaction.
If you make only minor changes to a context that has already been used in a legal transaction, such as changing the end date for the context.
If you try to use Save for a major change, the system issues an error message informing you that you cannot save because the draft is not consistent.
The error window in the bottom left corner the following error message is issued:
Context has importan changes; save as new version.
Owner
Use this field to search for the person responsible for the context.
You use this field to search for the person responsible for the context.
Per default, the user who creates the context is the owner of the context.
However, this can be changed at any time to the user who is actually responsible for the context from a content perspective.
The owner of a context, therefore, is not necessarily the person who maintains the context in the system.
You can enter the name directly, or use the value help to select a user.
Release Compatibility
Column indicates release compatibility for custom test processes.
While editing any custom test process, you can verify Release Compatibility for any custom process step by clicking on icon.
The system will purpose status based on change in application UI.
System will propose one of the possible indicators To be Verified by User, Non-Compatible, Compatible.When there is a significant change in the App used by Custom test process step, this may affect execution, hence indicated as Non-Compatible or To be Verified by User.
You need to adapt custom test process as per the changes in the App by SAP.
You also need to mark release compatibility status withVerified by User.
Product Allocation Objects
Lists product allocation objects.
The Product Allocation Objects subscreen lists product allocation objects.
By choosing a product allocation object, you can navigate to the Product Allocation Planning Data screen where you can create and change planning data for the product allocation object.
Restrictions
If business documents have already consumed allocation quantities of a specific characteristic value combination, you cannot change or delete the corresponding characteristic values.
If you have decided that collective allocation is to be managed by the system, you cannot create collective characteristic value combinations manually.
If you have chosen to create collective allocations manually, use hashes (#) to replace characteristic values that do not need to be specified explicitly: only a single hash should be used to replace a characteristic value.
Ensure that you set the collective symbol starting with the highest ordinal number to the lowest ordinal number, meaning no collective characteristic value should be succeeded by a specific characteristic value (for example, 0001, #, 01 or #, 001, 01).
Properties
The drill-down dimensions, measures, and other information used in the step.
The drill-down dimensions, measures, and other information, for example, the currency, used in the step.
Ensure you select only those properties that shall be displayed in the representation.
For hierarchical steps, enter the non-hierarchical properties.
These are the properties that are displayed in the columns after the first column of the table.
Ensure you only enter the following as non-hierarchical properties:
Measures
The text of the hierarchical property
Properties that have the same value across the entire hierarchy, for example, the reporting currency
Do not use other drill-down properties apart from the hierarchical property because the tree table cannot handle additional drill-down criteria.
Confirmation Status Bar
Shows progress of the confirmation for an order item.
The Confirmation Status bar indicates the progress of the confirmation for the order item.
It offers the user two different representations of the same data:

After Modify
Use this pattern to recalculate data after modification.
This pattern is used to recalculate data immediately after node instances have been created or edited, and then saved.
Logic of this pattern overwrites field values such as text strings or dates.
If node instances are deleted, this pattern is used to inform dependent nodes of the deletion and trigger their recalculation.
Sample use cases:
You want to count the subnodes that are contained under the root node of your custom business object, or you want to store who last modified a custom business object.
Lock Secondary Costs Posting
Locks the cost center for secondary costs posting.
When this option is enabled, no secondary costs can be posted to the cost center.
This option locks the cost center against posting debit secondary costs.
However, credited secondary costs can still be posted.
The default settings for this option are based on the Cost Center Category settings.
Secondary costs are used for internal cost allocations within Controlling.
They do not affect the data in Financial Accounting.
Date Range Control - Example
You want to choose a date range from October 1 to October 15.
You choose Date Range from the dropdown list in the first field, click the calendar symbol in the second field and pick the dates (October 1, October 15) from the calendar to define the date range for the line items.

Shows issues for a top-level demand.
The inspector detects capacity issues per top-level demand and displays them as red-colored cells.
Select the red-colored cells one by one to view all capacity issues associated with the top-level demand.
From the top-level demand you can click Multi-Level Material Simulation to navigate the a structured view of the bill of material and make simulations on component level, for example change the source of supply or to have a component preproduced.
Capacity Overload
Issues can relate to the selected top-level demand but it can be caused by other top-level demands as well.
Check the issue with care and investigate what caused the capacity overload.
For each top-level material, the inspector shows the Share of Consumed Capacity, that is how much this top-level demand contributes to a capacity overload.
Click Capacity Plan Simulation to see and edit the capacity of the corresponding work center.
Relative Basic Finish Date
Specifies the finish date of an order in relation to the current date.
The basic finish date is the planned finish time of an order.
You can make settings to specify a basic finish date that is relative to the current date.
You can enter negative values to specify a time in the past.
The finish date is then calculated backwards in calendar days.
By default, -30 days is set.
In combination with the entry for Status 1, the orders, that match this status on the specified date, will be set to closed.
If the time zone set in Define Recurrence Pattern is different from the time zone used by your servers, the system will recalculate the relative basic finish date based on the server time zone.

Duplicate Check for Master Records
Checking for potential duplicates of a master record
A duplicate check at the point of creation of master data allows a user to discover any potential duplicates already existing in the system.
If potential duplicates are suggested by the system, the user has the option to either abort creation of the new instance, or simply proceed with it if he decides that the new record is not actually duplicate data.
On clicking the Check button, first, the app performs functional checks on the records and displays errors, if any.
For example, in case, you have not maintained the Description field for the draft record, the application will generate an error message and will stop further processing until the errors are resolved.
If the functional checks are completed without errors, the application will show the list of potential duplicates that exist for the current draft record.
In the dialog box that opens, the basic details of the current draft record is shown first, followed by the list of top potential duplicate records that match the current draft record.
Standalone Selling Price
Standalone selling price of the good or service
This amount is the standalone selling price of the good or service multiplied by the quantity.
For project-based transactions, the standalone selling price is entered by the project manager.
For sell-from-stock processes, the standalone selling price is normally based on the condition stored in the pricing procedure of the order.
The value of the condition is calculated automatically when the order is created.
However, if no condition master record exists, the amount must be entered manually in the order.
The amount cannot be zero.
Accounting Impact
Shows journal entries related to the revenue recognition transactions.
The journal entries can be displayed either as T accounts or as a table.
In the T-account view, journal entries are displayed in a T-letter form, with debit and credit entries shown on either side of the T. To learn more about the T-account view, see.
If the Use Opening Balance filter is set to Yes, the first row of the T account shows the account's opening balance before the posting, while the last row displays its closing balance after the posting.
Opening Balance – The balance of entries to the account before the selected document was posted.
The opening balance equals the closing balance that was carried forward from the previous document posting.
Closing Balance – The balance of the account after the selected document has been posted.
The closing balance is a sum of the opening balance before document posting and all entries posted to the account with the selected document.
Both the opening balance and closing balance are calculated relative to the accounting period specified in the Document Range filter.

You use this indicator to calculate the decomposition of market values (spot, forward, CCBS, and other components) for selected financial transactions that are assigned as hedging instruments in designated hedging relationships (P-HA) created during the Automated Designation Process.
The calculation is made for a hedging instrument as well as for the corresponding hypothetical derivatives.
When a financial transaction is part of more than one hedging relationship, the calculation is made separately for each of the hedging relationships.
The calculation is always made for the nominal value of the financial transaction.
The proportional value relevant for the specific hedging relationships is calculated within hedge accounting.
You can restrict the calculation by selecting specific valuation areas

various IDs for specific application departments.
You must have the appropriate access authorization in order to access these texts.
Purchase Orders Not Approved
Displays not yet approved purchase orders for non-stock material
The card displays the number of purchase orders that have not yet been approved for non-stock material that is required as spare parts in maintenance orders.
The non-stock material is required for maintenance work in the reference period that you have chosen.
Purchase orders that have not yet been released are selected either by using the requirement date or the required start date.
If the non-stock material was requested whilst the maintenance order was being processed, the material requirement date that has been entered in the reservation is used for the selection.
If the material was ordered directly and assigned to a maintenance order, the required start date of the order is used for the selection.
If you wish to display all the purchase orders that have not yet been approved with their items in a list, click on the card.
In the list, you can branch to the purchase order, the detail data for the material and the maintenance order, or display the contact data for the supplier.

On the cards for the individual purchase orders in the carousel, you can also branch to the maintenance order or the purchase order and display them.
Interest Rate Swaps
Interest rate swaps are transactions that exchange payment flows on the basis of different interest rates in the same currency.
You agree on a certain term, usually over a year.
An interest rate swap enables you to hedge possible interest rate risks.
Possible combinations of interest rate swaps are:
Payer
Receiver
Basis
You can display the two cash flows for an interest rate swap either together or separately.
This provides you with an overview of the incoming and outgoing payments.
For swaps with a variable interest rate calculation, manual or automatic interest rate adjustments are carried out over the course of the term and the cash flow is gradually filled with the current values.
A company finances an existing investment with a fixed interest loan at 6.5%.
The company treasurer expects falling interest rates and, therefore, agrees an interest rate swap with a bank.
From this interest rate swap, the company receives a fixed interest yield of 7.25% and pays a variable rate of 6-M-EURIBOR.
The company, therefore, has the following interest rate costs:
Interest expenditure of 6.5% and 6-M-EURIBOR
Interest yield from SWAP of 7.25%
This results in interest expenditure of 6M-EURIBOR - 0.75%
Change Inventory Prices
Change prices for inventory valuation
Enables you to change the prices used to value the quantity of the material in inventory.
The price change becomes effective on the specified posting date.

If you use the combined display, any selection that you make in the graphic is also reflected in the table display.
You can also choose between different graphical displays.
Corner Texts
Texts that are displayed in the four corners of the step thumbnail.
Texts that are displayed in the four corners of the step thumbnail in the analysis path display.
All of them are optional.
The fields are prefilled with the texts entered at step level, if applicable.
When a text is entered or changed on representation level, this text takes precedence over the corresponding text entered at step level and is displayed at runtime.
When you now again change the same text at step level, this change is not copied to the representation and also not reflected at runtime.
This only applies to those representations where a change has been made on representation level.
Project Team
See who's working on the project that includes the resource request.
See who's working on the project that includes the role for which the resource request was created.

Define which properties are applied to the data request and subsequently to the chart as sorting criteria.
You can also specify the sorting direction (ascending or descending) for each property.
If you don’t specify a sorting field, the data is displayed in the order provided by the OData service.
If sorting criteria have been defined in the Data Reduction section of the step configuration, they are copied to the representation and cannot be changed here.
Not all representations support sorting by more than one property to the full extent.
Relative Basic Finish Date
Specifies the Relative Basic Finish Date of an order relative to the current date.
The basic finish date is the planned finish time of an order.You can make settings to specify a basic finish date that is relative to the current date.
You can enter negative values to specify a time in the past.
The finish date is then calculated backwards in days.
By default, -5 days is set.
In combination with the entry for Status 1 = (CNF) for orders that were confirmed (CNF) five days ago, the orders, that match these criteria, will be set to technically completed.
Production Storage Location
Use this for issuing the material during the production process.
A production storage location supports backflushing.
This means that a goods issue for the material is posted automatically when you post the production order to stock.
The issue location in the item is displayed in the production order as a default.
When you enter a BOM item, the system checks whether the material is defined for the chosen plant and storage location.
You can only maintain a production storage location for material items that are relevant to production and/or plant maintenance.
If an item that is relevant to production is defined as a bulk material, you cannot make an entry for the production storage location.
For production purposes, the storage location in the BOM item overrides the storage location in the material master.
If you have not entered a production storage location in the BOM item, the system uses the value from the material master.
Message Status
Provides you more information regarding the assembly.
The Information icon appears if any or all of following exists for an assembly:

Here you assign the categories for your legal transaction.
Categories are represented in a tree structure as independant hierarchies of values.
The categorization of objects in Legal Content Management helps to find the best match between each other.
You create the categories in the Categories app and assign them to a profile.
The profile that you assign to the context determines the categories you can select and assign to the context.
You order the assigned categories in category groups.
You can add and remove categories.
The Required attribute indicates whether this category is required in the legal transaction or whether it is just a recommendation and may be removed in the legal transaction.

The assignment time period is initially set to the start and end dates of the existing assignment.
You can change the time period as required, but make sure that the start and end dates are within the resource request start and end dates.
The following applies:
If you change the assignment for the same time period, for example, by specifying a different number of hours, the existing assignment is automatically deleted and replaced with the new assignment.
If you change the time period, a new assignment is created and added to the existing assignment, which may cause overbooking of the resource.
To avoid overbooking, delete the existing assignment first.
Contract for Limit
Specifies the number of the contract from which you can select service items.
The Contract for Limit specifies the number of the contract from which you select the items of the performed services in the service entry sheet.
This is part of the following scenario:
In the purchase contract, the purchaser has defined the potential set of services that may be required for a specific project in your company.
In the purchase order, the purchaser has created a limit item with product type group Service.
The purchaser assigns the purchase contract to this limit item by entering the number of the contract into the Contract for Limit field as the source of supply.
In the service entry sheet, you maintain the number of the purchase order as the Reference Purchase Order.
The system derives the number of the purchase contract directly from the purchase order item and displays the contract number in the Contract for Limit field.
By entering the Purchase Contract Item, you select the respective service items from the contract.
The purchase contract also determines the price per unit for each service.
Upload Invoices
