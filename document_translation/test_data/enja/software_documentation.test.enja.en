Shows asset origin displayed either by country/region or by supplier, and the KPI shows the total value.
The data shown is for the fiscal year and period that you selected in the filters.
Note that asset country/region of origin and asset supplier are both non-mandatory fields in the Master Data.
Assets for which this information is not maintained will be included in an unlabeled column on the left of the chart.
You can navigate from this card to the Asset Balances app.
Transaction Type
Payment transaction type for processing electronic bank statements.
Use
From the F4 help, you can select one of the payment transaction type that were defined in the configuration activity Make Global Settings for Electronic Bank Statement.
The payment transaction type is used in the following scenarios:
Posting rule determination:
In combination with the External Transaction on the bank statement item, the posting rule is determined.
In the case that no payment transaction type is specified for a house bank account, the SAP predelivered payment transaction type for the selected format is used during importing the bank statement using the Manage Incoming Payment Files app and the <locked-ref> API.
Bank fee validation:
Together with the bank service mapping in the Manage Banks app, it allows the system to identify the service volume for a certain bank service in end-of-day electronic bank statements.
The volume is then used to validate the bank fees in the Monitor Bank Fees app.
Please note that for manual bank statements, the system uses the transaction type entered in the manual bank statement.
For more information, see Validating Bank Services Charges.
Generate
Trigger the creation of the report file.
Use
Trigger the creation of the report file based on the specified data.
Once the generation of the report file is triggered, the report status is automatically changed to Generation Scheduled by the system.
The system generates the report file in an .xlsx format.
Once the report generation is completed, the report status is automatically changed to Generation Finished.
The report file name is created automatically based on the report name and reporting period selected.
Flexible Distribution
Enables you to create contracts in the connected system for a target quantity or value up to the total that you set in the central contract.
Use
The Flexible Distribution feature enables you to create contracts in the connected system for a target quantity or value up to the total that you set in the central contract.
Instead of assigning a fixed share of the quantity or value of the central contract to each of your subsidiaries, you can set the distribution percentage for each connected system to 100%.
As a result, the respective purchasers at each of your subsidiaries can create putchase orders in the connected system for as for as large or small a share as they need, rather than being limited to a fixed share that was predetermined by the central contract.
For example, if you have two subsidiaries, rather than assign each subsidiary a fixed limit of 50%, you can assign each of them 100%.
That way, if one subsidiary only creates purchase orders for 20% of the total value or quantity agreed in the central contract, the other subsidiary would have the flexibility to order up to 80% if they need to.
Note that if you enable flexible distribution, you will not receive an error message if the sum of the distribution exceeds 100%.
Therefore, it is important that you monitor the situation to make sure that your subsidiaries do not create a total sum of purchase orders that exceeds 100%.
Create Variants

INVD (Invoiced):
The account or its summary account was invoiced for charges and taxes due.
DDBT (Delayed Debit):
The account will be automatically debited on a future date
In a hierarchical structure, charging typically occurs only at a specific level.
For example, if all lowest level detail accounts are charged at the detail level, then the higher level accounts or summary accounts present the totals of the charges and taxes that occurred at the detail level.
If detail account charges are totaled or calculated at an intermediate level and charged at that level, then the higher level accounts or summary accounts present the totals of the charges and taxes that occurred at the intermediate level.
There should be no recalculation of charges and actual debiting or invoicing at levels above where the actual charging occurs.
Processing Order
Sequence in which conditions are executed.
You can define the sequence in which conditions are executed.
The more granular conditions (with more filters) always have to be executed before the more broadly defined conditions, which serve as a fallback.
This means you can create one condition that doesn’t have any filters.
This condition has to be the last one on the list.

In case of a limit item for services, a service entry sheet can be created if required.
It is also possible to post an invoice immediately.
If you record the performed services and their price and quantity using the Manage Service Entry Sheets - Lean Services app, the system displays the Expected Value of the limit item in the service entry sheet and reports an error if the stated amount exceeds the Overall Limit.
When creating a purchase order with limit items (item category E), the account assignment categories C, K, P, S, N, A, F, and U are currently supported.
You can view purchase order confirmations for limit items on the confirmation tab of the item.
Integrating Data From SAP HDI Containers
Access SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure (HDI) containers through <locked-ref> and use your data in the Data Builder or gain access to your space data from your HDI container.
What's an HDI container?
The SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure, or HDI for short, provides a service that enables you to deploy database development artifacts to so-called containers.
This service describes the deployed (run-time) state of SAP HANA database artifacts, for example: tables, views, or procedures, which have been created or adjusted by the SAP Integrated Development Environment (WebIDE) editors as a family of consistent design-time artifacts for all key SAP HANA platform database features.
These artifacts are modeled, staged (uploaded), built, and deployed into SAP HANA Cloud.
For more information on the SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure, see SAP HANA Cloud Deployment Infrastructure (HDI) Reference.
Why would you need to access HDI containers?
If you already have HDI containers and would like to use existing data models in your <locked-ref> environment you can easily make them accessible in your space.
You can then work with the models by enriching them or using them for a Story.
You could also allow your space data to be consumed in your HDI containers.
Then you can work with the models that you created in <locked-ref> within your HDI environment.
What are the prerequisites?
The following roles need to be assigned to your HDI container:
DWC_CONSUMPTION_ROLE - e.g select on the required tables
DWC_CONSUMPTION_ROLE# - this role has all the privileges from DWC_CONSUMPTION_ROLE, but with the additional grantable option
How to acces your HDI containers?
There are a few steps you need to take if you want to access your HDI container or if you want your HDI container to consume the models and data from your space.
For both scenarios, you need to create an SAP ticket so we can map your HDI container with your <locked-ref> space.
For a simple step-by-step guide to get started see Mapping your HDI Container to your Space.
Privileges
List the current available user privileges with the following statement select * from effective_privileges where user_name = current_user;:

Click the card header to see all due orders and operations that are in one of your work centers.
Click a row in the table or a bar in the chart to see due orders and operations that have a specific priority.
Migrate Set-Based Groups
Considerations for migrating set-based groups.
When migrating set-based groups, such as activity type groups, please note the following:
Migration of groups can't be transported between systems.
Therefore, the migration must be done separately in both quality and production systems.
For a 3-system landscape, the migration needs to be repeated in development, test, and production systems.
During migration, the applications or configurations that use the groups (where-used list) are automatically updated to the new hierarchies.
Note that some group usages are configurations, for example the activity type groups used in Define Splitting Structures, the changes to them need to be executed in quality system and transported to production system.
To ensure consistency, SAP recommends you to migrate groups in all relevant systems and then release the transport requests for configurations.
Group ID can't exceed 15 characters.
Please pay special attention to the groups with subnodes, because during the migration, a subgroup is automatically generated for each subnode.
The subgroup ID is comprised of the new parent group ID, the special character "~", and subnode ID and tends to be long.
Therefore, avoid specifying long IDs as new group IDs.

Write Off
Write off billing amounts, which are due for Time and Expenses items.
Use
To write off amounts associated with Time and Expenses items:
On the To Be Billed tab, select one or more items as required and choose Write Off.
Confirm the write-off action and verify that the selected items have moved from the To Be Billed tab to the To Be Written Off tab.
The To Be Billed amount of the billing element, seen in the header section of the Prepare Billing page, gets updated with the new amount calculated as follows:
To Be Billed (after write-off) = To Be Billed (before write-off) - Amount written off
Where,
Amount written off = (Sum of (Quantity to Be Written Off * Sales Rate) for those items where Quantity to Be Written Off is not 0) + (Sum of Cost to Be Written Off for those items where Quantity to Be Written Off is 0)
Non-billable items are written off by default.
You can see these items on the To Be Written Off  tab and verify that they're non-billable by looking at the Billing Control Category column.
These items cannot be included under To Be Billed.
After submitting the project billing request, the written off amounts cannot be brought back into any billing cycle.
Even if a billing clerk rejects the billing document request, the written off amounts continue to remain written off.

Automatic Posting Scenario
Business context for automatic postings.
Represents a business context where an intercompany matching and reconciliation process can trigger automatic postings, for example, elimination posting, adjustment posting, subledger clearing posting, and accrual posting.
It determines document header fields, control options, and document item fields that are available for defining posting rules.
SAP delivers the following automatic posting scenarios:
SA001 (Posting Adjustments for Accounting)
SC001 (Elimination Postings for Group Reporting)
User Group
The user group bundles technical users according to common characteristics.
Here you can define the required user group of your technical user.
There are several types of technical users that take on technical tasks in your system:
SAP Technical Users
These users are predefined by SAP to run operating tasks in the system.
SAP technical users are also required for customer-specific tasks, such as running and scheduling jobs.
The required job template contains the SAP technical user needed to run the job by default.
Communication Users
Communication users are technical users required for communication between your system and any integrated system.
The following types of communication users are available:
SAP communication users:
Predefined by SAP
Communication users :
Created by customers
Custom communication users are created in the Maintain Communication Users app and are assigned to systems for inbound and outbound communication.
These technical users either use basic authentication or certificates to communicate between your system and the integrated system.
The communication system, together with a communication scenario, is assigned to a communication arrangement.
Thus, all communication scenario roles are assigned to the communication user which provides this user with all permission required for the connection between your system and the integrated system.
Print Users
The print user is the technical user with which SAP Cloud Print Manager logs on to the system.
SAP Cloud Print Manager establishes the connection between print queues and local printers.
This user can be created in the Maintain Print Queues app.
Support Users
SAP uses support users to provide customers with support if issues occur in the system.
These users only exist temporarily and are deleted by SAP after the support process is completed.
TRM_RC_Facilities
Facilities are agreements between a lender and a borrower, which control the general conditions for a series of drawings against a credit line.
The lender can give drawing authorization to several people (= borrowers), who are entitled to draw varying amounts at any time up to the total approved credit line.
The utilization of this credit option for a facility is called a drawing.
The lender calculates charges for the borrower (commitment interest).
The charges that incur are calculated according to different methods.
Confirmed facilities
The lender guarantees the availability of a limited credit amount at any time.
The borrower has to pay a charge for this.
Unconfirmed facilities
The lender does not guarantee a credit limit.
No charges are made for this.
The functions for managing facilities include functions for creating and processing them.
You can assign deposits at notice, cash flow transactions and interest rate instruments to a facility.
You specify which money market transactions can be assigned as drawings on the Rules tab page.
For an overview of the transactions that have already been assigned to the facility, see the Profiles tab page.
Enter Manual Contract Accruals
Adjust the accruals
Allows you to adjust the accruals.
Manual accruals are overwritten by the next revaluation, that is, with either of the following:
The Revalue function in this app
A periodic revenue recognition run executed with the Run Revenue Recognition – Service Documents app.
The manual contract accruals function generates a source document.
Message Severity
Messages related to the import of compliance requirements.
When you specify a file for import, the app analyses its data and reports potential issues with it.
Then, if there are no severe issues that prevent the import, the data is recorded in the system.
Issues with severity Error, either caused by the details of the compliance requirement or the subordinate paragraphs, prevent the import of the entire compliance requirement.
To facilitate the correction of the import file, the app displays information about the skipped compliance requirements.
Issues with severity Warning do not prevent the import of the corresponding compliance requirements.
Assignment Time Period
Enter the date or time period for which to create an assignment.
If you choose the Total Hours rule or the Daily Hours rule, you can change the time period.
This is useful, for example, if you want to break the overall assignment down into different segments using different distribution rules.
However, make sure that the start and end dates of the assignment are within the resource request start and end dates.
You can also use the calendar to specify the assignment time period.
If you choose the As Requested rule, you cannot change the time period.
Where Does the Preset Time Period Come From?
Change Category
The change category indicates how a finding can be solved.
The following categories are available:
Technical:
The finding can be solved by performing technical changes in your custom code.
For example, a technical change can be a replacement of a SELECT statement with an API call to reach the same functionality as before.
Functional:
The finding can typically not be solved by performing technical changes.
To solve the functional finding, you might need to re-design the application.
Not specified:
It is not specified whether the required change to solve the finding is technical or functional.
Application Configuration
Configures the currency and exception rules for your app.
Use
For the app currency, you can choose either the controlling area currency or the company code currency.
The settings you make for exception rules influence the values shown in the Exception Status column in your result list.
The column can show a status of green, yellow or red status.
You can define the threshold and basic criteria for each status here.
In the Rule Basis field, choose the criteria for the rule, and whether it is triggered by a percentage value, an absolute value, or both.
Define the absolute or percentage thresholds for your rule and save your settings.
Services Rendered Date
Specify the date on which the services were provided
Use
You can use the services rendered date to specify the date on which the services were provided.
The system uses this date for tax calculation per billing request line.
By default, the system uses the billing date as the services rendered date.
For service contract items (item category SCN1), services rendered dates are displayed only.
For price adaptation (item category SCN2) and ad-hoc billing (item category SCN3), services rendered dates are editable.
What's Changed
Identifies what has changed in the compliance requirement.
Definition
Identifies what has changed in the compliance requirement, which could be one of the following:
New Compliance Requirement:
The first version of a new compliance requirement has been released.
New Version:
A new version of the existing compliance requirement has been released.
Update of Existing Version:
The existing compliance requirement version has been revised and released again.
Manage Scheduled Jobs
To change scheduled jobs
Use
If jobs have been scheduled for posting periods, you can change them by choosing this button.
Here's how you do it:
To change scheduled jobs, do the following:
Select a posting period variant for which a job has been scheduled (and is displayed in the Scheduled Open Period column).
Choose Manage Scheduled Jobs.
Select a job type and action (or all of them) and choose Go.
You can now delete the jobs that are displayed.
New Filter for Employee Responsible
Filter service contracts according to selected employee responsible.
Use
A new filter Employee Responsible is available to replace the old Responsible Employee filter, which is being deprecated.
In the value help of the new filter, all search results are restricted to the employees responsible for service contracts, excluding those with the business partner role Employment.
When the deprecated filter Responsible Employee is removed, it disappears from the customized filter settings.
You can add the new Employee Responsible filter to your filter settings in advance.
Assessment Progress
View the assessment progress on assessments with released successor.
Use
When a new version of a dangerous good regulation is activated, the system generates classification requests for the affected products.
For the new classification requests, there is no released successor available because the successor is created in status In Progress.
Therefore, the assessment progress section gives you an overview about how many products have been reassessed and their classification has been released.
Once the graphic indicates that all assessments have a released successor, the reassessment according to the new version of the dangerous goods regulation is completed.
If you select the blue part of the bar chart, the dangerous goods assessment list displays only assessments with a release successor available.
If you select the orange part of the bar chart, the dangerous goods assessment list displays only assessments without a release successor.
Matching Expression
For comparing the values calculated for the relevant data slices.
An equation defined using left- and right-hand matching fields, a comparison operator, and optionally, conversion functions.
Matching expressions are used for comparing the values calculated for the relevant data slices.
By default, when you choose the left-hand field, the same field on the right hand is selected automatically provided the second slice has the same field.
However, the two sides don't have to be with a same field but a same data type.
Matching expression is not needed for matching rules with the match type Group as Assigned or Group as Matched.
And it is also not mandatory for the other three match types.
For example, if a matching rule with the type Auto-Assign doesn’t have any matching expressions, it means all the items filtered by the two slices are grouped under one assignment.
The Function column allows you to make conversions for the values of matching fields.
It is data-type-dependent, for example, we provide “SUBSTRING” for string-like fields and “CONVERT_CURRENCY” for amount-type fields.
Comparison operators are also data-type-dependent.
For numeric fields, “OPPOSITE” and “TOLERANCE” are available in addition to the common operators such as “=”, “>”, “<>” and so on.
All Payments
Make the payment available again in all users’ worklists
On this tab you can remove the processor from a payment to make the payment available again in all users’ worklists.
Use
In addition to the payments in your worklist, this tab also contains payments that are assigned to other users.
Usually you work only on payments in your worklist.
However, if a payment is assigned to another user who cannot finish it, open the All Payments tab and remove the user as the processor by clicking Remove Processor.
The payment then becomes available in all users’ worklists and can be processed by another user.
Low-Level Code
Click to select the lowest level of a material in a BOM.
Use the value help to define the lowest material level that you want to include in your reference data for your simulation.
The low-level code is the lowest level that a material appears in any product structure of the company.
The low-level code controls the sequence in which the material is planned in an MRP run.
First the materials with low-level code 0 are planned, then the materials with low-level code 1, and so on.
The lower the low-level code, the higher the number that is assigned to the material.
The low-level code is set in the material master record when the BOM is maintained.
Exchange Rate Type
A classification of exchange rates based on their use.
Exchange rates can be used as a buying rate, bank selling rate, or average rate.
The selected exchange rate type is used when translating or converting currency amounts.
The following exchange rate type is predefined in the system:
M- Standard translation at average rate
Other exchange rate types are:
AVG - Consolidation Monthly Average Rate
CLO - Consolidation Monthly Closing Rate
P - Standard translation for cost planning
Global ID
Team global identifier
A team global ID uniquely identifies a team across multiple systems.
For example, when you need to have the same team in production and quality systems, or any system or service which can store a team in responsibility management, you need a team global ID that is the same in all systems.
A team global ID cannot be empty, cannot be longer than 40 characters, and cannot be changed after it is saved.
When you create a team, the team global ID is automatically populated with a team name, after you enter a team name.
If needed, you can change a team's global ID before you save a team's definition.
For an existing team created in an earlier release, you need to enter a team global ID so that the team is available via <locked-ref> and <locked-ref> ODATA APIs.
A team internal ID is generated automatically but is unique to the system in which it is created.
Therefore, if you need a reference to a team, SAP recommends that you persist the team global ID and not the team internal ID.
Expiration Date
Specifies the valid-to date of regulations, permits, and policies.
Definition
Specifies the Valid To date for compliance requirements.
Compliance requirements that have been replaced or revisioned and need your attention are color-coded as follows:
Compliance requirements whose expiration date is approaching are marked in yellow.
Compliance requirements whose expiration date has passed are marked in red.
Add from Regulation
Add data about substances with occupational exposure limits from the regulation.
Definition
Adds data about one or multiple substances with occupational exposure limits to the unpackaged product or raw material directly from the most recently activated Health and Safety Management regulation whose lists are assigned to the Safety Data Sheet Management regulation used for the compliance assessment.
Use
The system adds data about one or multiple substances with occupational exposure limits to the unpackaged product or raw material directly from the regulation.
Once a given substance with occupational exposure limits is already added to the unpackaged product or raw material, you cannot add it to it again.
Share Schedule
Add others as planners or reviewers.
To share the schedule, add one or more people as maintenance planners or reviewers.
Adding Someone as Maintenance Planner
All maintenance planners have full permissions and can modify, share, or delete the schedule.
Adding Someone as Reviewer
Reviewers have read-only access to the schedule and cannot see the utilization forecast shown when the schedule is in Scoping or Refinement.
Reviewers do not require any work center assignment.
Revoking Access to the Schedule
To unshare the schedule, just remove the name of the person whose access you want to revoke.
Basic Description
If the product is a dangerous good, add a basic description.
Definition
Specifies a text describing the dangerous good.
Use
If you have classified the product as a dangerous good, you have to enter a dangerous good basic description.
When you choose the (+) Add icon, the system prefills the description with a text containing the values from the classification data.
You can change the description, if needed.
Admin Information
Header section of the situation type.
Displays the basic information of a situation type.
When you create a new situation type, enter an ID and a name.
You can change (overwrite) the name suggested for the copied situation template or situation type in the name field.
The ID of your situation type should start with a Y or Z. Make sure the ID doesn't contain special characters.
Under Display Sequence, you can define the sequence in which situations are displayed:
If multiple situation instances exist for a business object, they’re displayed on the object page according to the value for the display sequence.
Upload Cycles
Download and upload template for cycle and segment definitions.
Use
Use this function to download a preformatted CSV file template that you can use to create new allocation cycles and segments or edit existing ones.
After you have made your changes to the file, use the same function to upload the completed template.
When using this function:
You can only use it with the cost center and profit center allocation contexts.
You cannot edit the uploaded data within the Manage Allocations app.
If you want to make changes to data, then you must download the file again, make your changes, and then upload the file again.
You must enter cycle information on each sheet within the file.
The following fields must be completed and consistent on each sheet:
Cycle ID, Allocation Context, Ledger, Valid From.
When entering data on the Senders and Receivers sheets within the file, specifying a From Value without specifying a To Value means you are entering a single value.
The order of the sheets within the file cannot be changed from the default order.
They must stay the same as they were when you downloaded the template.
On the Description sheet within the file, you can only use those values which are relevant to the context and universal allocation.
Overtime Category
Use this field to capture overtime.
Use
You can choose an Overtime Category to capture the time invested by service employees in addition to their planned working time.
Overtime is planned like regular working time.
When you use an Overtime Category for a service order item or service confirmation item, the price of the service increases.
If the Overtime Category is Weekend, the price of the service increases by 50%, if the surcharge is defined as 50%.
Service employees can change the Overtime Category.
For example, if a service employee works on a Public Holiday whereas the Overtime Category planned was Weekend, they can change the Overtime Category.
If you want to record unplanned overtime, you must create an additional service confirmation.
Review Finished
Lists accruals that have been manually or automatically reviewed.
Use
Accruals that have been successfully reviewed display on the Review Finished tab page.
The following accruals can be of status Review Finished:
Accruals that have been manually reviewed in this app
Accruals that have been automatically reviewed because the amounts are between the threshold range.
Accruals that have been manually reviewed in the Review Purchase Order Accruals - My Inbox app
As the review process is not required, you can post accruals directly that need reviewing but haven't been reviewed.
Auto-Match
To run matching based on the rules in the current matching method.
Choose the button to run auto match for your specified leading unit and partner units based on the method.
During the matching run, the Assign, Communicate, and Auto-Match buttons are grayed out.
This is to prevent concurrent activities on the same data set and to avoid any data inconsistency.
Upon completion of the matching, the buttons are enabled again, and data refreshed.
For any existing assignment that has the reason code Temporary Resolution checkbox selected, the matching run unassigns and invalidates the assignment number, reads and rematches the latest data from the relevant data sources, refreshes the processing status, and triggers any follow-ups required by the reason code.
However, if the assignment is still in the process of automatic adjustment or approval workflow, the auto match run skips it.
Search Date
Select a search date or run a date-independent search.
Use
You can execute the search for any specific date to see recipes that are valid on that date, be it past, present, or future.
You can also decide to search recipes without specifying a search date by selecting the Any Date option.
If a search item is not present in a recipe throughout the recipe's entire validity, you will see a warning in the result list with details about the change.
If a specific search date has been selected, the system uses the selected search date as the recipe's key date when you navigate to a recipe directly from this app,.
You still have the possibility to change the key date in the Calculation Parameters window.
Add Resource
You can search for and staff people to a project.
Use
You use this function to search for employees or service performers and staff them to a work package.
The search is performed on all delivery organizations that belong to the company code of the project's service organization.

The Tax Calculated by Partner column displays the tax information as calculated and returned by your tax partner.
You can compare the information in this column with the corresponding information in the Tax in Journal Entry column.
The information in these two columns typically match, reflecting that the information was communicated in an Update call.
If the information in these two columns don’t match, then there was a discrepancy between what your SAP system calculated and what your tax partner returned.
This indicates that the successful update was a Force Update.
In the case of a Force Update, the Tax Calculated by Partner is provided for your information and reference.
Capacity Sequence Groups
Lists sequence groups for capacity allocations and their values.
The Capacity Sequence Groups subscreen lists sequence groups for capacity allocations for the product allocation sequence.
You can use a capacity sequence group as an alternative source of product allocation that is checked after a product availability check has been executed.
The confirmation from the preceding product availability check is the request (date and quantity) for the product allocation check against capacity.
If the available quantity in a capacity sequence group is insufficient to fulfill a requirement, the available quantity in the next capacity sequence group is also considered.
Like sales sequence groups, capacity sequence groups are consumed according to their priority.
Defaultable Business Partner

Manage Your Data Products
Manage the data products you want to offer to your consumers.
For each data set that you want make available to consumers in the Data Marketplace app, you create a data product.
It contains data in an envelope with meaningful metadata which is displayed on the products detail page and is used for searching and browsing through the various data products.
When you create a data product, most of the metadata and information you enter will be visible for consumers.
It helps them to evaluate your data product and it can influence their buying decision.
As a data provider, you decide on the pricing model for a data product: a data product can be either free of charge or require the purchase of a license at a certain cost.
You also choose whether to ship your data products as one-time deliveries or as regularly updated versions.
Once you've created a data product, you list it to make it available to consumers.
Target Balance
Specifies the target account balance of this bank account.
Use
If the bank account is defined as a subaccount of a physical cash pool, you can define a target amount for this bank account.
Otherwise, this field is not relevant.
The target amount defines the target bank account balance for this bank account in cash concentration simulation.
According to the defined target amount and pool usage, the system proposes the cash concentration as follows:
When the account balance of the subaccount is greater than the target amount, and the cash pool is defined as Both Direction or Cash Concentration, the system proposes to transfer money from the subaccount to the header account.
When the account balance of the subaccount is smaller than the target amount, and the cash pool is defined as Both Direction or Cash Distribution, the system proposes to transfer money from the header account to the subaccount.
This value is for simulation only.
Users can edit the transfer amount according to their needs.
However, the Minimum Transfer Amount must be considered if it is defined.
Planned Count Date Interval
Defines the relative time interval to schedule a job for creating the PI documents.
Definition
Defines a relative time interval for which you want to determine the creation of the necessary physical inventory documents for your cycle counting process.
The Planned Count Date Interval based on a date function with a time-based value help for the days in the future.
You can only display and use this Planned Count Date Interval field when you use the date selection type Relative.
Use
A predefined value help supports you in choosing a value for the next x days in the future.
You can choose between Next 1 day and Next 180 days.
You can maintain this predefined value help with your own values.
To do so, a user with the Analytics Specialist role can use the Manage Date Functions app.
You can use this app to define very flexible time options, for example, you can define last day of next week, first day of next month, and so on, as the end date.
Remove Constraints
Remove existing constraints for the selected order operations.
Remove existing date constraints for the selected order operations.
You can remove constraints for order operations that are not yet in process.
Enable the display of relationships and Must start on constraints for operations in the settings (<locked-ref>).
This option can be useful in the following cases, for example:
You've canceled the dispatch of an order operation.
You now want to remove the Must start on constraint that was set automatically when the operation was dispatched.
You've set a new start date for an order operation that has a successor operation.
Due to an existing Must start on constraint, the app can't adjust the dates of the successor operation.
Once you remove the constraint for the successor operation, the operation can be rescheduled automatically.
The successor's dates are adjusted automatically if both operations are included in the same maintenance order.
If you've created a cross-order relationship, you must trigger order scheduling manually to have the operation dates adjusted.
View Legal Composition
Navigate to the screen where you can see the legal compositions.
Use
Navigate within this app to the screen where you can see the legal compositions and the related information.
The first step of the navigation is to choose the composition type and the status of the composition that you want to see.
You can identify the screen of the legal composition by the title Legal Composition.
To be sure which legal composition you're working on, check the header data area, where <name of composition type> - <name of product> is displayed.
Save as New Version
Use this function to create a new version of the context.
You use this function to create a new version of the context.
A new version of a context can only be created if it is assigned to at least one legal transaction and a major change is applied, such as adding a category.
If you choose Save as New Version and the context is not yet assigned to a legal transaction, an error message informs you to use Save instead.
If you save a new version, a dialog asks you to set a status for the new version.
You can set the status to either Ready or Active.
If you set the status to Active, the system sets the status of the previous version to Replaced and the connection between the two versions is indicated by the Replaced By and Previous Version fields in the general data of the context.
The legal transaction keeps the context version that was originally assigned.
The new version can only be assigned to new legal transactions.
Phases
Start or restart a phase in this facet.
Use
You can start or restart a phase by selecting the available phases.
Phases govern the compliance of a legal transaction.
Once a phase is defined in the Manage Contexts app, it will be available in this facet.
You can define the starting conditions for a phase, either as parallel or sequential.
Parallel condition allows multiple phases to start parallely, whereas sequential phases ensures the phases are triggered in a sequence.
You can also see the iteration details of a phase to know the number of times a phase has been repeated.
In addition, you can see which legal document is assigned to a phase and also the current state of a phase - whether content exists in the legal document or if the document is in accepted state.
Base Currency

Working in the Chart
Learn how to work directly in the chart.
Enable the display of non-working times, work center utilization, relationships, and constraints in the chart settings (<locked-ref>).
To zoom in (or zoom out) in the timeline at the cursor position, press and hold CTRLSHIFT, then scroll up or down.
Drag and Drop Orders and Operations
You can change the start date and time of maintenance orders and order operations by dragging and dropping them one at a time to the desired date in the chart.
If you drag and drop a maintenance order, any included due or dispatched operations are moved as well and any existing constraints on the operation dates are removed.
If you drag and drop an operation bar, the app sets a new date constraint for the start date of the operation.
For more information, see <locked-ref> in the product assistance.
Change Operations
To change order operations, for example, by changing the performing work center, dispatching the operations, or removing any date constraints, you can either use the toolbar buttons or the context menu for an operation bar in the chart.
Using the toolbar buttons, you can change multiple operations at once.
With this option, you must select the operations by marking the checkbox in the table.
Using the context menu, you can change one operation at a time.
With this option, you don't need to mark the checkbox, just right-click the operation in the chart.
Work with Relationships
You can create and delete relationships between order operations and add offsets between related operations.
To create a relationship between two order operations, proceed as follows:
Select an operation bar and then one of the connection points at the beginning or end of the bar, depending on the type of relationship that you want to create.
Draw a line to the relevant connection point of the operation that you want to relate to the selected one.
If both operations are in the same maintenance order and the related operation does not have a Must start on constraint set, the start date of the related operation is adjusted automatically.
To delete a relationship or to add, edit, or delete an offset for a relationship, right-click the relationship in the chart and select the relevant entry from the context menu.
Note that the context menu is only available for explicit relationships.
For more information, see <locked-ref> in the product assistance.
Hierarchy View
Display the G/L accounts in YCOA in the expandable FSV structure.
Use
In the Hierarchy View, you can drill down the selected FSV structure to a specific G/L account.
You can then navigate from the G/L account to other apps that you have the authorization to access, for example, the Manage G/L Account Master Data app for editing account attributes.
If you have the proper authorization, you can also copy an existing G/L account to create a new G/L account.
In this view, you can't sort or filter the columns.
If you need those functions, please use the List View instead.
Communication Status
Shows if communication has been made for a matching item.
Shows what communication means and content have been made for the matching item.
The following communication statuses are available:
Not Started:
No communication yet.
Note Added:
A public note was added.
Notification Sent:
A notification was sent to someone for clarifications.
The recipients receive the notification in the header bar of the SAP Fiori launchpad (<locked-ref> icon).
Since communication activities are in chronological order, only the latest communication status is shown in the list.
However, you can view the communication history by choosing the status.
Tax Country
Where RITA is enabled, tax country is the tax reporting country.
Definition
Registration for Indirect Taxation Abroad (RITA) enables indirect tax calculation for multiple countries within a single legal entity.
The tax country field allows you to maintain a tax country that is different from the company code country.
Rather than calculating and reporting indirect taxation at the company code level, RITA uses the tax country plus the tax code to determine the tax rates and relevant G/L account determination for tax-relevant transactions.
Use
Tax country is always used in combination with a tax code.
If no tax reporting country is entered in the document, the system uses the company code country by default.
Normally, documents contain only one tax reporting country, but there are numerous business cases with multiple tax countries in a single document.
An example would be an incoming supplier invoice with two tax countries, one for goods, the other for services.
Another example can be sales of goods with different tax departure countries, or sales of services to customers in countries where the services are taxed by the receiving country.
In these kinds of cases, the tax country is maintained at the line-item level, which simplifies payments and reporting of indirect taxes.
Situation Instances
Section in which you define the situation instance behavior.
Use
In this section, you define basic situation instance behavior:
Trigger Accumulation:
Disabled is the standard behavior.
It means that each situation instance is displayed on a separate situation page in the <locked-ref> app.
Change the default setting only for specific use cases.
For more information, refer to the Situation Instances section in <locked-ref>.
Instance Closing Behavior:
Close and Keep:
This is the standard behavior.
When a user manually closes a situation, it is kept in the system and can be reopened.
Close and Delete:
When a user closes a situation manually, it is deleted from the system and cannot be reopened.
Responsible Employee (Deprecated)
This filter is being deprecated.
Use
This filter is being deprecated, which means it will be removed from the Manage Service Contracts app with SAP S/4HANA Cloud 2208 or later.
When it's removed, it also disappears from the customized filter settings.
You can add the new Employee Responsible filter to your filter settings in advance.
In the value help of the new filter, all search results are restricted to the employees responsible for service contracts, excluding those with the business partner role Employment.
Period Range
Filters displayed data to a specific time period only.
The time period defined in the Period Range field filters the data displayed subsequently for analysis in the Characteristic Value Combinations list.
The list displays those characteristic value combinations which have at least one period intersecting the period range.
Note that you can use the Period Range selection on the Characteristic Value Combination screen to define a differing time period for displaying product allocation period data than selected on the Monitor Product Allocation Characteristic Value Combinations screen.
Data is displayed for those period entries whose start or end dates intersect with the defined period range.
If no period range is defined, the start date of the Period Range selection defaults to the current date.
Change Work Center
Move the selected operations to another work center.
Level work center utilization by moving one or more order operations to another work center.
Here's how:
Select order operations by marking the checkbox.
You can change the work center for order operations that have the processing status Due.
If you want to change the work center for an order operation that you've already scheduled, you must reset it first.
This changes the operation's processing status back to Due.
Click this button and select a work center.
The drop-down menu includes all work centers that are assigned to you.
Once you select a new work center, the utilization forecast is updated automatically.
If the new work center has order operations that have already been dispatched or are in process and that overlap with the schedule period, these are added automatically to your schedule.
After the change, the order operation status changes to Due (Draft).
This means that the work center change is only visible in your schedule and is not yet saved in the maintenance order.
To save the new work center in the order operation, you must schedule and dispatch the operation first.

You can use the maintained data for the contact person as a filter for the list of purchase orders displayed in the object list of the app Manage Purchase Orders.
The data of the contact person is saved with the purchase order, not with the master data of the supplier.
Time Recording
Indicates if time recording is blocked.
Definition
Indicates if time recording is blocked for the selected project or WBS element.
Use
Time recording is carried out using the Manage My Timesheet app.
By blocking this function, you stop both posting and reversal.
Variant Name
Contains name of the variants used for run and additional, run-related information.
The Variant Name column contains the name of the variant used for the run as defined in the <locked-ref> app.
Backorder processing runs are normally defined to run in the background, meaning:
Business documents are updated to reflect the recalculated confirmations.
Locked documents are displayed but are excluded from the update.
If Summary is displayed below the variant name:
An exception was generated during the initial run.
To rectify the exception by providing a confirmation, at least one additional run was executed on the basis of a preconfigured fallback variant (fallback run).
The results of all the runs required to generate a confirmation have been merged in the summary.
If Simulation is displayed below the variant name:
The run has been executed in simulation mode to identify if the run would improve the confirmation data generated during a live run.
Locked documents are not excluded from the simulation.
To re-run backorder processing, click Simulate Variant in the variant popover.
Copy Item
Copy existing item to add new one
Definition
Enables you to add items to the sourcing project by copying the existing items.

You can edit these newly created items and item sets the same way that you would edit other newly created items.
Slow-Moving Indicator by Plants
Displays two key figures for one material in all available plants.
Definition
Displays the key figures Slow-Moving Indicator and Stock Quantity for one material in all available plants - except the selected plant - based on the parameters key date and days with low consumption.
The chart has been enhanced with two further key figures used for orientation:
Slow-Moving Indicator and Stock Quantity.
Both are based on the filter criteria you have set in the header.
Use
The chart supports you to find plants that have a low Slow-Moving Indicator and a high Stock Quantity at the same time.
In this case, surplus stock could be transferred to a plant with a high Slow-Moving Indicator but a lower level of stock quantity.
You can directly navigate from a selected plant to the Transfer Stock - Cross Plant app to initiate such a stock transfer.
Note that such a stock transfer has two opposite effects:
For the issuing plant the Slow-Moving Indicator will increase due to the fact that the stock quantity decreases.
For the receiving plant the Slow-Moving Indicator will decrease due to the fact that the stock quantity increases.
Value Group Overview Settings
Adjust overview settings
Via the Settings icon, you have the following options for the Value Group Overview:
Add or remove columns to the overview

Debit / Credit Material
Adjust the inventory value
Enables you to adjust the inventory value of the material.
Enter the posting date and a header text for the material document.
For all currency types, specify the revaluation amount and the reference quantity for which the costs are to be posted.
Depending on the price control, the revaluation amounts are posted to a price difference account and/or to the material stock account:
For standard price materials (price control S), the revaluation amount is posted to a price difference account.
The standard price of the material is not changed.
For moving average price materials (price control V), the revaluation amount is posted to the material stock account unless stock coverage is insufficient.
If stock coverage is insufficient, only the portion for the available stock is posted to the stock account; the remainder is posted to a price difference account.
Example for Moving Average Price
A material with price control V has a base quantity of 100 units and an inventory quantity of 50 units.
The inventory value is EUR 500.
If you enter an adjustment of EUR 100, EUR 50 is posted to the material stock account and EUR 50 is posted to the price difference account.
Exposure Items
Represent the exposure of an analysis item.
Definition
Exposure items represent the exposure of an analysis item and are saved on the database.
You create exposure items using the Take Snapshot app.

Only Net
The amounts of the incoming and outgoing exposures of the analysis item are aggregated to the net exposure.
This net exposure amount is saved as the net exposure item.
Only Gross
The incoming and the outgoing exposures are saved as incoming (gross) exposure item and outgoing (gross) exposure item respectively.
Net and Gross
Incoming gross exposure item, outgoing gross exposure item, and net exposure item are created.

Budget-Relevant
Influences for expenditure postings the availability control and the consumable budget.
Definition
The budget-relevant indicator is an important setting and updated as part of a journal entry in the Universal Journal (ACDOCA).
The behavior of this budgetary setting is however differently interpreted for accounts classified as 'Expense'’ or 'Revenue' types.
Use
In the case of commitment and actual 'Expenses', the budget-relevant indicator determines whether availability control (AVC) is performed and budget is consumed.
In AVC reporting, this is then reported as part of the Amount Consumed.
General ledger accounts classified as 'Revenues' in the budgetary settings of a general ledger account do not participate in AVC nor are they reported as part of the Amount Consumed.
The default setting for those revenue type accounts is 'Not Budget-Relevant' (indicator is not set).
The budget-relevant indicator can however also be set for revenue accounts, which allows for distinction in reporting.
Technical Objects
Displays the available technical objects and their details.
Definition
Technical objects have two types:
Equipment: physical object which is an autonomous unit.
Functional location: component in a technical system on which you can perform a maintenance task.
Use
You can find information about, for example, maintenance plants, manufacturers, and planner groups which are related to the technical objects.
If you click the technical object name, the application provides navigation targets to further technical object actions.
To find information about the related maintenance notifications, orders, and items, you need to click the row of the technical object.
